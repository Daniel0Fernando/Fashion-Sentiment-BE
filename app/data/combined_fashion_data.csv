Their collection seamlessly blends style and functionality, making it a go-to choice for everyday wear and casual outings.

Carnage,"Last week, my friend placed an online order for me from Sri Lanka but accidentally entered the wrong address. We immediately contacted your support team via email and I also called them same day morning to rectify the issue. I was advised to send another email with the correct address, which I did, and requested confirmation once the change was made.

Unfortunately, I never received a confirmation, and the parcel was picked up by DHL with the incorrect address. I had to reach out to DHL directly to request the address change once again, which added unnecessary stress and complication.

While I have always respected Carnage for its quality, I believe there is room for improvement in your customer service.

I hope this feedback helps improve future interactions :) 2 Desh Perera"

Carnage,"Carnage: A Disappointing Detour
I was once a die-hard fan of Carnage. Their edgy designs and unique style resonated with me, and I proudly wore their clothes. However, my unwavering loyalty has taken a significant hit.

The quality of Carnage's products has drastically declined. What used to be durable, stylish pieces has transformed into cheaply made items that barely survive a few washes. It's disheartening to pay a premium price for clothing that falls apart so quickly.

To make matters worse, the customer service has plummeted. Gone are the days of friendly and helpful staff. Now, customers are met with indifference and a complete lack of care. Trying to exchange a faulty item or seek assistance with an order has become a frustrating ordeal.

It‚Äôs truly sad to see a once-loved brand deteriorate in such a manner. I hope Carnage takes notice of these issues and takes steps to rectify them. Until then, I'll be looking for new brands that value both their products and customers. 4"

Unfortunately, the overall shopping experience fell short of expectations. The store lacked my required size (Large) in the desired t-shirts and (Small) in the intended shorts. Furthermore, despite observing approximately seven staff members, none offered assistance which is disappointing. Thought Carnage would do better.

Carnage,"Prepare for a fashion experience that's larger than life and funnier than your uncle's dance moves at a wedding! The Carnage Desire Oversize Tee is the ultimate statement piece for those who want to rock a shirt that's more spacious than a first-class airplane seat. It's so roomy, you could fit a family of squirrels inside and still have space for a mini-fridge! Not only does it provide excellent coverage for a hot dog eating contest, but it's also perfect for hiding that extra slice of pizza you want to sneak into a movie theater. With its vibrant colors and enough fabric to make a quilt, this tee is guaranteed to turn heads and cause laughter-induced bellyaches.

Crocodile,"I recently visited your outlet and had a mixed experience that I'd like to share. On my first visit, I was assisted by an employee named Ridma. He was extremely helpful and ensured my shopping experience was smooth. I ended up purchasing three T-shirts, three casual trousers, one office trouser, and some casual wear. I was in a hurry that day, so I couldn't get the trousers adjusted for length. The next day, I returned to the store to get the measurements done but had forgotten my invoice. Since Ridma was busy with another customer, I approached another employee, a bald gentleman. Unfortunately, his response was very negative and dismissive, which left me feeling disappointed. Can't they even bring the bill? We have been told not to accept yours. I don't even know if the ones brought from other places will be manufactured under our labels. This cannot be named. Work has increased these days. It will take days to find that bill. Customer service plays such a big role in creating a lasting impression, and I don't think this individual demonstrated the skills or attitude required for the job. Thankfully, Ritma overheard the conversation and stepped in. He immediately recognized me from the previous day, tracked my invoice with just my mobile number, and resolved the issue efficiently. His professionalism and attentiveness were outstanding. I highly recommend providing the other employees with intensive customer service training, particularly on how to handle situations with a positive attitude and a smile. First impressions matter, and his approach left a negative impact. To Ridma, well done! You are an asset to the store, and I hope your dedication is recognized and rewarded. Thank you for making my experience memorable despite the initial challenges. Harsha Jayathilaka"

But for the polos if you're hoping to buy light colours better to have them ordered online since most of the polos are out of stock. Same applies to the shirts as well.

Unfortunately the ordered size was too small and I called and informed their helpline about the issue. The lady who answered my call was so kind and took efforts to check the availability of sizes from same design from store, and called me back. Outlet staff were also nice and accepted the return and were polite in helping me to choose the correct size.

Crocodile,"I had the pleasure of visiting the Crocodile Flagship Store in Colombo last Sunday, and I must say, it was an extraordinary shopping experience. My primary intention was to purchase some T-shirts, but I left with a newfound appreciation for the impeccable quality and craftsmanship this store offers. Upon entering, I was immediately struck by the elegant and tasteful layout of the store. The merchandise was neatly displayed, creating an inviting atmosphere that encouraged exploration. The store exuded a sense of luxury without being ostentatious, setting the stage for the premium products it housed. The selection of T-shirts was diverse, with a wide range of colors, styles, and sizes. Each piece was a testament to the brand's commitment to quality. The fabrics used were of the highest grade, ensuring comfort and durability. The attention to detail in stitching and finishing was evident, promising longevity even with frequent wear. It was clear that every garment had been meticulously crafted. One of the standout features of this establishment was its collection of wallets made from genuine crocodile leather. These wallets exuded opulence and sophistication, reflecting the brand's dedication to using only the finest materials. The craftsmanship was exceptional, evident in the precise stitching and impeccable finishing. Handling these wallets, one could feel the luxurious texture and appreciate the durability that comes with genuine crocodile leather. While the products at Crocodile Flagship Store may come with a premium price tag, the quality unquestionably justifies the investment. The durability and longevity of the items ensure they will remain in one's wardrobe for years to come, making them a true value for money. The staff at the store were attentive and knowledgeable, providing helpful suggestions and ensuring a seamless shopping experience. They were able to answer all my queries about the products and provided valuable insights about the brand's ethos and commitment to quality. In conclusion, my visit to Crocodile Flagship Store in Colombo was nothing short of exceptional. The highest quality products, particularly the T-shirts and wallets, combined with the store's elegant ambiance and knowledgeable staff, made for a shopping experience that was truly one of a kind. If you're seeking premium, enduring pieces for your wardrobe, this store should be at the top of your list. It's safe to say that Crocodile Flagship Store has set a new standard for luxury shopping in Colombo. Shameez"
Crocodile,"I ordered a pair of flip flops maroon colour through the website. By mentioning the size as but they have sent me the pair of flip flop from the size and it's too small for me. I ordered it because at the website it was mentioning that the size was availabe and also in the receipt it's clearly mentioned that I have ordered the size . These people are just cheating the customers if they doesn't have the size they should have update the website or else just inform me that they doesn't have it In stock so that I can go with another option, before sending my order through the courier and also it took days to receive my package.

However, the issue I encountered was with the lady working there. She wasn't very supportive and seemed to look at customers with annoyance. I'm not sure about the reason, but it would be better if she were a bit more polite. Despite that, it's still the best place to visit for Crocodile fans. Rasika Gunathunga"

Crocodile,"I recently visited your store and had an unfortunate experience with a shop assistant. I noticed a stain on one of the T-shirts available for purchase and politely inquired about it. Instead of addressing my concern professionally, the assistant suggested that I clean the stain with toothpaste. When I expressed that paying full price for a stained item didn‚Äôt feel like value for money, the response was dismissive and unhelpful. I believe customer-facing staff should be trained to handle such situations with empathy and professionalism. It‚Äôs essential for a brand like Crocodile to ensure customers feel respected and valued during their shopping experience. I hope this feedback helps improve service standards, and I‚Äôd be happy to discuss this further if needed. Naveen Karunarathne"

I tried to contact them in different ways more than 10 times but I couldn't reach a proper person to talk about this.

It was supposed to be my New year clothes and I don't need it if I don't receive it before New year. I need a money refund and don't know whom to even reach. Very disappointed about their online ordering system and customer service. DON'T OREDER FROM THEM ONLINE. 5

I absolutely love their linen range, specially the linen shorts because they‚Äôre as comfy as a pair of shorts can get. I‚Äôve literally started to second guess myself whenever I have to wear jeans or any other heavy piece of clothing after trying out their linen products. All in all, they‚Äôve grown to be quite a good store to buy very unique, fashionable and comfortable stuff to wear. uttara peiris"

Emerald,"Brought  pairs of short sleeves shirts ( cm). The shirts priced fairly reasonable however, some of the stock are quite old so be vigilant. One of the shirt which I adore the most has burnt crease. Staff minded their own work and didn't bother us at all we took our time in selecting. The place is pretty basic, no A/C nor accepting card payments. The outlet is near Elvitgala Mw, about  m away from the Kirimandala Mw junction. Finding a good parking spot maybe challenging fortunately we went around .pm on a Sunday (hardly anyone on road). DThiral A  Chamara Nanayakkarawasam"
Emerald,"This is a good place if you are looking for a quality shirt for a bargain price. Obviously, the products are not in the best of the condition but they are well worth the price tag. They have a limited range of products and sizes. The sales person is super helpful and polite. You can brows through the available options as much as you like. It recommend that you check the products carefully and read the tags before making a purchase. Some of the tags contain information about the defects in the product. All in all, it is a good place to visit while you are shopping for shirts. jayali gunawardena"

Try had to contact them few times but they aren't very responsive either. Somehow after few days they have found my order had no issue and even though one of their agent confirmed the payment received via email the same day I ordered, their excuse was that there was an issue with the payment.

I placed an order for next day delivery, despite being within Colombo - and the next day being a working day, as per their conditions for next day delivery.

Wanted to exchange and my calls were constantly hanged up and when you they pick up they weather its for the birthday sale and they say delivery time takes bla bla without me even asking for it. First teach your customer service people to learn what are the basics of customer service. We are paying for this, you are not handing this over to us for free. After few calls they said that they can replace this, they gave me a whatsapp number and I contacted him/her. That number was offline untilpm and they never saw or replied to my text. I called back customer service number and they said they can‚Äôt help someone reach out to that person only you can help you. Now it is my duty to search for that person and process my replacement?

I hope they improve their communication and resolve issues more effectively in the future.Theekshana Athukorala Arrachi"
FOA,"Bought a pair of shoes online since they looked good and comfortable to the picture, but realized otherwise after receiving the pair. Shoes are not comfortable and are very bad quality. I know the price is bit cheap but still not worth buying. The customer service is really bad. It tookdays to receive the package and during that time I tried to contact the store through emails and through provided telephone numbers but they never responded to any of those. I understand that there might be a delay with the delivery due to huge amount of orders but at least they could have responded to the calls/emails."

FOA,"Worst customer service ever-Never order from them again!!!! I ordered a crew neck T-shirt and joggers from FOA on August,, and as of September,, I still haven‚Äôt received any notification that my order is ready for pickup. I chose store pickup specifically because I‚Äôve heard about their delays, but this has been excessive. After several attempts to contact customer service, I was initially met with silence, and when I finally got through, they told me my order would be ready by Friday. Now, their contact numbers are unavailable. My cousin had a similar experience, waitingdays for her order, and they even pressured her to remove her negative review after she finally received it. It‚Äôs unacceptable for a brand to take overdays to prepare an order, especially when other retailers manage to fulfill orders much quicker. FOA claimed they were overwhelmed with orders, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse such poor service. When I called to cancel my order, their response was dismissive, reflecting a lack of concern for customer satisfaction. I strongly advise against ordering from FOA. They present themselves as a premium brand but fail to deliver on that promise. Save yourself the hassle and choose a more reliable retailer.Asma Asma"
FOA,"Hi, I have received superb service and excellent clothes from F.O.A.

FOA,A high quality pair of shorts that marries comfort with style.
FOA,Good stuff and amazing customer service! Loving the black crossbody bag
FOA,"I recently placed an order (Shoe) during the Augustst sale, and the experience has been incredibly frustrating. You advertise yourselves as a ‚Äúreputed business‚Äù that ‚Äúvalues its customers,‚Äù but based on my experience, but guess what that‚Äôs a complete joke. I paid in full, and was promised it would be ready for pickup within few days. Guess what? No product, no updates, and absolutely no proper communication and its beendays now. I‚Äôve sent multiple emails, all of which have been completely ignored. I‚Äôve called three times, only to hear the same pathetic excuse about being overwhelmed with orders. That‚Äôs not my problem. If you‚Äôre going to run a sale, you better be able to handle the volume, period. A so-called ‚Äúreputed‚Äù business wouldn‚Äôt drop the ball like this. And today, I was lied to again by your customer service rep who swore I‚Äôd get an email update by within couple minutes. And, shocker, no email. This is completely unacceptable and shows that your company either doesn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs doing or doesn‚Äôt give a damn about its customers. If this is what you mean by ‚Äúvaluing customers,‚Äù then I‚Äôll be thinking long and hard about ever doing business with you again. I want my order ready immediately‚Äîno more excuses‚Äîor I‚Äôll escalate this further. I also expect an explanation for this disgraceful service. You seriously need to reevaluate what being a ‚Äúreputed business‚Äù means, because right now, your reputation is circling the drain. *********Don't be like the politicians the business will die soon if you guys doesn't give a damn about us**************"

FOA,Totally disappointed their customer service. they don't know how to treat to their customers. we're not going buy clothes free of charge üòÇ. Worst customer services ever. Not only enough their brand quality.
FOA,"I‚Äôm very disappointed with my recent experience with FOA Clothing. I ordered a T-shirt during their birthday sale on Augustst, but I've been trying to check the delivery status for over a week now. Last Friday, I was told my order would arrive on Wednesday, but that didn't happen, I was then informed it would arrive today. However, today, I called again to check on my delivery, only to be informed that my item is out of stock. They never called me to provide this update. I‚Äôm frustrated that my order was taken without notifying me of its availability. They mentioned they would process a refund, but I haven‚Äôt received any follow-up, despite reaching out multiple times. The customer service has been lacking, and this experience has left me quite upset. Very disappointed!!!"
FOA,Bought the duffle bag online. Was delivered indays. Been using it for less than two weeks now. Got caught in the rain once and the FOA print is peeling off already. Pretty bad quality print I must say. Hopefully the duffle bag won't fall apart like the print.
FOA,"I ordered pair of sneakers from your site. But still i did not receive it. I payed uber delivery charge for one day delivery also. And it's disappointing when a company doesn't answer their phone, especially for online orders. And i tried to contact via massenger and whtasapp. But they are not replying. Efficient communication is key to good customer service. Hopefully, you'll improve your responsiveness in the future."
FOA,Color discrepancies between online images and the actual product were off-putting.
FOA,"Material durability is lacking, making them less practical for everyday use."
FOA,FOA is my favourite place to shop at. They have the best oversized tT-shirts. Their quality is next level. Love this shop. Sulaiman Sajjad
FOA,The shorts are incredibly comfortable
FOA,"FOA has always been a go to brand for me. Purchased a lovely set of oversized tees and croptops for my girl. She was super satisfied with the quality of the merchandise. The environment at OGF branch was welcoming. We wanted to do an exchange afterwards, when we called the hotline a pleasant individual named Shenal provided an excellent service to meet our required. Looking forward to visit again soon. Cheers FOA"
FOA,Finest clothing brand which is super comfortable Ushan Chamod Hettiarachchi
FOA,Dilum is a very supportive and friendly person . He has good sense of fashion . Great guy
FOA,It is a local Brand. They have met the quality of an international brand. Their prices little bit low than international brands. I bought a pair of shorts only. Only one colour available. They have sold out all stock of black. Material is good. Need to use it for some time to comment on it much.
FOA,"Vibrant color options that resist fading, even after multiple washes."
GFlock,"New Over the past year, I have placed multiple orders for GFlock clothing, but unfortunately, my experiences have been disappointing. The first time, I was informed that the dress I ordered had been discontinued due to a factory defect and was asked to choose a replacement. However, I was surprised to find that the same dress was still available for purchase on their website. The second time, I placed an order, but even after a month, the dress has yet to be delivered. Once again, I was told that the item had defects and needed to be addressed at the factory. This is not the level of service one expects, especially when purchasing a dress that costs around , rupees! Update: After waiting for more than a month I was told that the dress I ordered and paid for is unavailable. The customer service agent previously told that they will contact me after the dress became available again. But, today after waiting for more than a month I contacted them again and then only I was told that the dress is not available. They didn't even bother to call me. Such poor communication and horrible customer service! Dulashini Wanniarachchi review¬∑ photo"

GFlock,Clothing shop with modern and unique designs. But if you want to buy their new designs better you go there on the day of release. Initially they mainly targeted the women‚Äôs clothing but now they have introduced men‚Äôs as well. Two storied clothing store with ground floor for women and first floor for men. Less selection for men comparatively. Have common fitting rooms. But may be not adequate in busy days specially when there are sales. Staff is friendly and helpful. Few vehicles can be parked in front of the shop and there‚Äôs a separate car park near by with enough space. Kalana Prasanka Kalana Prasanka Imaa review
GFlock,"There is a wide variety of clothes for women and men. No items for children. Usual prices are above Rs., for women. Ground floor has ladies items which consists of sections for shoes, denims, office wear, Cotton clothes and casual items as well (T, shirts, blouses and frocks). Most of the ladies items are made of Georgette which is less suitable for a country like Sri Lanka. Their denims are the best and not so rough like other denims. So i would highly recommend GFlock for denims. As a CSR initiative, they give away plants for free. Parking facilities are very limited. Therefore, will have to park on the Galle Road. The entrance Menswear Keshini Dias Denims section Keshini Dias Shanika Nilukshi"
GFlock,"I ordered from GFlock Global, but the sizes were wrong. I usually wear size , but their size was completely different. When I complained, they said it couldn't be wrong, which was frustrating. I compared it with my new denim, and they still insisted it was right. Don't buy from GFlock Global if you're not in Sri Lanka. Very disappointed. Shanika Nilukshi Shanika Nilukshi Shanika Nilukshi Shanika Nilukshi"

GFlock,"I recently visited this store for the first time and was impressed by the wide range of office and casual clothes for ladies. The selection is stylish. The staff were very helpful. You can order the clothes through their website, which offers the convenience of online shopping with various payment methods including Mintpay. One downside is the limited parking in front of the shop. However, there is a public parking area about meters away on the right side which helps mitigate this issue."
GFlock,No much collection for gents and no waiting area. Parking is super hazel here. Only vehicles parking at time and they announce once you block with other vehicles. This is super annoying .

GFlock,The Kollupitiya branch has a very good collection of dresses now. The store is neatly organized. Some items are unreasonably pricey and there is not much of a collection of jeans either. You can definitely find a dress for an event. Malmi Saparamadu
GFlock,"I had a horrible experience with GFlock's online service. I ordered an outfit and returned it to their Colpetty outlet on 17th August for an exchange. Despite following up multiple times, I never received my exchange code. Their customer service is non-existent no one picks up calls, and there is zero communication. It's clear they don‚Äôt care about their online customers. I‚Äôve been left frustrated and without a solution. If you‚Äôre considering shopping online with GFlock, think twice‚Äîtheir service is inefficient and unreliable. Save yourself the headache and shop elsewhere. Binu Lorenzuhewa"
GFlock,Gflock Pelawatta offers an excellent selection of clothing. The staff are friendly and go out of their way to serve each customer in a personalized way.

GFlock,"Went last week and there were some glaring issues . The music is way too loud which made for a terrible shopping experience. If you spend more than - minutes in the shop you might actually go crazy . The sales people/assistants were very intimidating and were too busy flirting with each other to actually help people . Most items are extremely over priced and was very low quality - most items had make up/ dirty stains and were damaged/ stitching had come off. . The sizing is way off and lacks uniformity - I could wear sizes ,, and it was very confusing and time consuming to find the proper size. . The items look different to the ones posted on their website - so be mindful when you are searching for the same item in store. Overall do not recommend as it is not worth the price you are paying. This is too bad because I actually liked this store. Inosh Perera"

Other branded shops ODEL,MONDY , AKIRA they didn't asked bill if item has it original price tag. Please think twice when you are shopping like is classy shopping center.

GFlock,Not recommended. Visited today. Surprised with the disgusting service. None of sales persons was interested to help except men sales persons.

GFlock,"Amazing collection of clothing with decent parking given the location of the shop.

The store had a wide variety of high-end designer clothing and accessories for both men and women. The staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, offering styling advice and helping me find the perfect pieces. The store itself was beautifully designed and had a very upscale feel. I was particularly impressed with the quality of the clothing - every piece felt like it was made with care and attention to detail. I left the store feeling very satisfied with my purchases and would highly recommend GFlock to anyone looking for luxury fashion. Chalani"
GFlock,"To be frank Its over priced. They have a good style collection but they are leveraging it too much. , - , for a normal dress is too much.

On the positive note the customer service is good and they update there styles frequently. sandani jayarathne"
GFlock,"Great place for women's fashion, well designed clothes at reasonable prices. Not cheap. However, the men's line is average, lacks variety and imagination. Perhaps because the men's line is still very new. It's a very busy shop anytime of day. Limited parking outside the premises, but they do have a fair amount of parking about a close distance away. My teenage daughter and my middle aged wife : ) both seem to love the place. Highly Recommended for women. Sandun Mendis"
GFlock,Favourite place to buy dresses. I used to buy online for several years now. Always deliver good quality stuff. But visiting the store in person has lot of difficulties.

GFlock,"A popular store for lady's clothes including great dresses. It has parking for about vehicles, but since the store is on Galle road, you can usually park your vehicle somewhere close by on Galle road. This is a single story building so is accessible even by a wheelchair. Considering the comments of the ladies I know, I think this is one of the better stores in Colombo. Yasas"
GFlock,Awesome collection and each one has different sizes to choose from. Made out high quality material. Not so crowded. Needless to say prices are a bit high but it's a bang for the buck.

GFlock,Quality ladies and gents cloths. The prices are a bit expensive for the quality of the products they offer. Especially the ladies footwear. They release a new collection every Monday online and you can even shop via their website. The store is spacious and well arranged. They rarely add new styles in the gents section. The staff here uses to he friendly and helpful when they started. But the current staff rarely helps the customers. GF Mgt should focus more on improving the customer service. Bamba Zillah

GFlock,Very ffriendly customer service. Specially Janesha helped to find the correct size & trending pieces. Collection is better than the main outlet in Colpitty as more sizes were available. Theshan Kalhara
GFlock,Worst online stall ever. It‚Äôs more than month Since I returned my items. No feedback until I called them today. And they said they will dispatch it today. Funny thing is they only send it for quality inspection after we make pay for the item. And that means they make us to pay for the items which are not good for sale. That‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt expect from gflock. Also once purchased they don‚Äôt allow us to exchange. Only a size exchange is allowed and if the size are not available then it‚Äôs over. You have to use the frocks that you purchased by paying in thousands may be to make pillow cases.because they don‚Äôt refund/give stall credit or allow us to but another product from that. They just said if the sizes are not available from the same design then they can‚Äôt do anything about it. I‚Äôm a regular online buyer and sad to say this is the only place with such a poor customer care!! Guys don‚Äôt get trapped in to their online stall where they take your money first by showing poor quality garments which are not suitable for sale and they they won‚Äôt allow you to exchange or refund. Pathetic!! Pamunuwa garment stalls are way better than you!! Shame on Gflock!! Kushmitha Selvaratnam

GFlock,This is their new outlet located in Pelawatta. Has a fairly decent range of clothing/dresses but comparatively less than the one at Colpetty. Certain dresses had no sizes in store. I felt that the store was kind of overstaffed (most of them staying at the ground floor) while only one staff member was in the first floor. There are about fit-on rooms ( in the ground floor and in the first floor). Items are somewhat pricey. They have a range of clothing for gents as well.

GFlock,"I had an excellent experience shopping at the GFLOCK Palawatta storeüòäüòäüòä. The staff was extremely kind and attentive from the moment I stepped in. I was in a hurry to buy a dress for the next day's function, and I entered the shop at the last minute, as it was about to close. However, the staff offered their help without being overbearing and opened the shop till I found a suitable dress for me., and they took the time to understand my style preferences and even suggested a few options that I hadn't considered but ended up loving. Their product knowledge was impressive‚Äîthey knew exactly which sizes and styles would work best for me, and they made sure I was comfortable and satisfied with my choices. The checkout process was swift and easy, and I enjoyed all the help they offered. You rarely encounter such friendly and elegant service. I will definitely comeback and recommend this store to everyone. Kudos to the excellent staff, especially Bhawani and Nadeera, for making my shopping experience so joyful! Tharushi Nethmini review"

GFlock,"I am writing to express my disappointment regarding my recent visit to your Pelawatte store. As a loyal GFLOCK customer for the past ten years, I have always appreciated the quality of your products and the service provided. However, my experience during my latest visit was notably unsatisfactory. On this occasion, I felt that the staff's attitude towards me was less than welcoming, and their behavior made me feel as though I was a burden. While I understand that first impressions can be influenced by appearance, I would like to emphasize the importance of treating all customers with respect and courtesy, regardless of their presentation on a given day. I kindly request that you address this matter with your staff. It would be beneficial for them to receive training on maintaining a professional demeanor and ensuring that all customers feel valued and respected. Judging a customer by their appearance is not conducive to a positive shopping experience and does not align with the high standards of customer service that I have come to expect from GFLOCK. I hope that future visits to your store will reflect the level of service that has earned my loyalty over the years. Anuradha HPT review¬∑ photo"
GFlock,"I was really disappointed with the fitting rooms. I went with my girlfriend, and she tried on a dress. The security lady near the fitting room didn't allow me to check how the dress looked on her. What's the point of having fitting rooms if we can't see how the outfit fits? NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!

GFlock,This was the first time I went to their battaramulla store. It was smaller than expected. They had a limited selection of dresses. The staff is helpful and overall a very pleasant experience. It has a few parking spots upfront which is convenient. It wasn't very crowded like their kolpity showroom. chamila kotambage review
GFlock,"Gflock is my favourite local clothing brand. And the Pelawatte branch is my go to branch for all my clothing purchases. The staff is very friendly and supportive. I usually go through their page n reserve whatever pieces I wish to purchase. Their staff of course my special thanks goes to Kevin since years n years he‚Äôs giving a superb service, helps to reserve the pieces just one txt away. And of course I grab them on my earliest. Have to mention that we do not have much space inside the store but im okay with that as long as I do selection on their page n visit the store to put on n buy them.. since i do not have much time to go through a store physically. Plus the dresses are perfectly fit for any occasion, currently im on an overseas tour n my luggage is almost full with Gflock‚Äôs clothes. Yeah I highly recommend this as their dresses are rich in quality as well the appearance. Thanks Kevin n GFlock pelawatta team.. Imali Udeshika review"
GFlock,"Very disappointed about the gflock online service & also the delivery service.I have ordered some sale items on 13th july.After days I emailed them no reply so, I talked to the online customer service, then they told me couldnt complete my order bcuz items hadn't available at that moment.their reason were due to the technical problem,even not available items are showing on the website.But they hadn't inform it until I ask them.I replaced items again & no response in days.I have to call again & again by myself to check my order.after all of that, today (23rd july) morning a delivery guy called me & I clearly mentioned the direction.Its not difficult.But in the evening when I call him he said he couldnt find the address üòñ.so he'll come tomorrowüôÑ..not going to buy again your products.please consider about the customers orders.

GFlock,"I recently had the pleasure of interacting with Kevin, Arun, and the team at GFlock, and I must say their customer service was exceptional. They were incredibly professional, knowledgeable about their products, and always approachable. They efficiently addressed all my queries, ensuring a smooth transaction. Moreover, they resolved a minor issue promptly, demonstrating their commitment to customer satisfaction. Overall, my experience was highly positive, and I would recommend GFlock to anyone seeking outstanding service."" Kalana Prasanka"
GFlock,Spacious Gflock branch. Has a good collection. Staff is friendly and helpful. Has got clothes for both men and women. Less selection for men. Kalana Prasanka
GFlock,"They do have a nice collection of women's clothing and I used to be a regular customer. However there was a power cut while I was there last week and gflock pelawatte had no backup power source, I waited there for about 15min and left the store. I would have expected better from a local high-end store like them. Utterly disappointed. Vindya Yapa"
GFlock,"Last week, I visited the Pelawatta branch of Gflock and tried on a number of outfits. And even though I frequent the store, they assumed I was trying to steal clothing. Whenever I visit, I usually make a purchase of clothing. I would advise my friends not to shop at this store and they lost a regular customer as well. They also provided extremely poor and disappointing customer service. They have no idea how to handle clients. I would advise anyone not to use this Pelawatta branch.Very disappointed‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è Mirko Kavisha"

GFlock,Opened relatively recently this outlet at the heart of Pelawatte has had great success. Two floors of clothing both mens and ladies are available in a contemporary atmosphere. While their selection is not extensive there is a sense of style with chic smart dressing options. They had a surprising good selection of linen wear. There is ample parking at the rear of the property so don't stress to park upfront. Staff is friendly and helpful. L√†l L

Well if you want access to the changing room there is a bit of a wait. Overall good place to shop for the whole family KC Sirimanna"
GFlock,They have to the worst exchange policy.when you buy some garments online you should get the chance of exchange 8f the customer is unhappy of the product.this can be very likely to happen as customers order just sent some model wearing it. GFlock do give exchange facility but it is very unrealistic for customers. everything happens through courier services. they should be implement the method used by odel.any customer regardless of online or in-store can walk into their exchange counter and get the replacement.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly and felt welcomed. The store offers an extensive collection of both casual and formal dresses, each piece reflecting excellent craftsmanship and style. I want to highlight the exceptional service provided by Shaira, one of the staff members. Shaira's dedication to her job and her customers is truly commendable. She was incredibly attentive, helping me find exactly what I was looking for with her knowledgeable suggestions and keen eye for fashion. Her friendly and professional demeanor made my shopping experience not only efficient but also enjoyable. The attention to detail in their dress designs and the quality of the materials used is evident, making Jezza Fashion stand out from other retailers. Whether you're looking for something casual or a formal outfit for a special occasion, you can trust that you'll find something perfect here. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my experience at Jezza Fashion, Dehiwala. I highly recommend this store to anyone looking for top-notch service and high-quality fashion.

Jezza,Ladies latest ready made dresses
Jezza,"Plenty of modest clothing for ladies. The quality isn‚Äôt that great, some materials get woolly/fluffy after a couple of wears and the sewing could definitely be better for the high prices they charge. They do exchange if you complain about the sewing defects or material issues after wearing which is only fair. Some items like pants are very overpriced. The staff is friendly and quite helpful, some can be quite pushy though. Yaz Deen"
Jezza,They should add more designer clothes.
Jezza,Favorite place. I use purchesing with available items. Anyway more designs need to be added. Some material Material quality should be improved. And need different pattern of tops. Consider the pricess. Above 3000 from single top is seems to be exaggerated amount. C.K. June
Jezza,"As a Muslim girl, I'm an often buyer from Jezza since it fits all my needs. However, their cloth materials are terrible. I've told them this several times. The material is synthetic and it doesn't have a lining. You get boiled in Colombo when you wear it. Once you wash them, they shrink and lose color. Additionally, their fit on rooms at dehiwala out are terrible . So many times I have complained to fix some bright lights . Inside that fit on room lights where not bright enough and you can see shadows. I simply love the quality of the product what gflock produce. I do buy products from them, but most of the times I don‚Äôt like to wear tight out fit. But couple of outfits I have bought and wearing it for almost 10 years and still when I wear people ask me from where I bought it. Material quality is good and simply has the class. Jezza everytime after the purchase I have only regrets. If you can‚Äôt take our feedback and improve you must stop cheating people and their hard earn money. I think spending on good cloths is an investment we do for ourselves."

Jezza,I've been in here three different times hoping something would catch my eye but I've never bought anything. Yes there is a large collection of good quality items but sadly I never found anything for me. Maybe there is a specific group of people who find it useful. The prices are so high that I really can't believe a simple viscose or whatever materials they have could amount to so much. I'm also curious why most of the dresses are a size 8 and below -_- The ones in larger sizes come in the most ugly designs. 1
Jezza,trying out Jezza for the first time for this Eid and loved their collection. Never a ready made outfit person but just so satisfied shopping today for a wedding too. And thanks to Shaira for actually helping out a lot. She actually is a great staff. Maybe plus sizes and a couple of bigger sizes added to the size guide would be appropriate. Sajida Siham

Jezza,Though they have a nice collection the dress material is not so good. Once washed it shrinks and then it won‚Äôt fit. If you charge more for dresses please be kind to check the material before sewing.

Kelly Felder,"I experienced bad service fromKellyfelder . I placed an order for a dress on April 9th and was assured it would be delivered on or before April 11th. However, as of April 14th, the dress has not been dispatched from their warehouse. After inquiring, they informed me that they do not have the dress in stock. This has been the worst service I have ever encountered"
Kelly Felder,If you're looking for both quality and style this is a place you must check out. Don't forget to check their SALE dates too.. just to dig out good pieces for a cheaper price

Color variety is pretty low though, also clothes variety range is pretty limited with most clothes looking the same, very minor changes between them. There staff is very helpful. Nice shopping environment. Overall the sheer quality and brand name attracts a lot of customers. There are also a lot of a discounts and stock clearance sales carried out here, allowing more worth for less money. Menuka Gunawardana"

Kelly Felder,"The staff here are so amazing.. I love the amount of training and how customer centric the staff at Kelly Felder are, I was here on the 24th, I was really tired after a day of Christmas shopping and when I went to Kelly Felder, I went to exchange some clothes I had bought online, the staff were really so polite and friendly, as someone who regularly shops online since covid, the whole experience of in-shop shopping is harder for me, being in a time cinch also, I asked a guy, can you show me this shirt, and showed it to him from the Kelly Felder website on my phone, the guy not only showed me where it was kept in the store but also asked me what my size was and he found it for me.. Being used to the atrocious uptight ego centric behavior of Gflock staff, I was so pleasantly taken aback, and the cashier (I wish I remember his name) he was super busy, but he noted that I looked tired and he asked me why, he was so friendly and chatted to me while he was ringing up my bill, with a smile, even though he was so busy, he had a smile and some very inspiring words for me, thank you Kelly Felder, your staff are a gem to you, I will consider shopping at Kelly Felder over GFlock because of the amazing staff they have employed.. Gflock staff suck BTW!"
Kelly Felder,"Good quality clothing with a lot of designs to suite ladies' desire. Prices are high, but ultimately they are designer clothing. So no complaints. Atmosphere is suited for shopping. Friendly staff. Praneedi Perera"
Kelly Felder,No accessibility options. They have a medium staircase to enter and a huuuge staircase inside to go to the first floor. I‚Äôm currently very pregnant and not supposed to climb stairs. Asked the staff if they have a lift and they simply said no. Weren‚Äôt even friendly enough to offer to bring down styles of dresses I‚Äôd like to see. Hence rating poorly for poor customer service.

Kelly Felder,Nice atmosphere and good staff. Only downside was there wasn't any sizes available on many of the clothing. Also went to buy some menswear from redvers buller and there was not much choice. But on facebook they had a great collection. Hope they will restock soon as wanted to buy few more items but they didn't have the correct sizes and availability.
Kelly Felder,"Good collection of women's clothes, and quite an affordable price (average range between 1500 and 3500 Rs). Sizes are in UK, US, EUR and AUS. Also the staffmembers don't follow you, so you can leisurely get a look at the clothes. Just one floor though, there is room for a bit of expansion.

However, they eventually took the dress and exchanged it for another one. By then, while I was browsing, everyone was staring at me and my boyfriend like we were thieves. It was such a terrible experience. Despite having a bill worth more than 10,000 LKR, they treated us like this."

However, the available size was not a good fit, I was worried about the fit, so I asked the salesperson, Vihanga, if they had my size. Vihanga went above and beyond by checking the stock and arranging for the dress to be shipped from the Maharagama warehouse to the Bagatelle store within an hour‚Äîjust for me!

Mimosa,"I have been a loyal customer of Mimosa for many years, consistently shopping at the Bagathale store. However, during my recent visit, I encountered a new store manager whose with big attitude and behavior were extremely disappointing. Unfortunately, I cannot recall his name, but his lack of customer service skills was evident. He behaved as if he owned Mimosa and acted like we were getting the clothes for free. His dismissive attitude and unwillingness to assist customers were unacceptable. When I asked for assistance, he did not respond properly and was very unhelpful. I urge the board of directors to look into this matter seriously. Customer service is crucial, and this manager's behavior does not reflect the values and standards that Mimosa is known for. He needs to treat customers with respect and without any attitude."

Please learn to treat customers regardless of how and what they wear cuz at the end of the day, people won't be purchasing things if they're treated like trash. Will not visit this place again."

I didn't have the bill as it was bought as a gift., but had the credit card payment receipt with me with the details. The price tag was attached.If it was from any other place I could have get it exchanged without any issue.

She made couple of calls to a manager or someone then agreed to give me a credit note. She was really really rude & I was totally despondent. When I leave the place & until I leave the place from cab , she came out side with other 2 girls who were working there , & they were looking at us & they were talking something, I felt that they were scolding us because they were looking at my cab directly.

Once called the first receiver said the dress was dispatched then recalled her statement. Next spoke to someone called Dulani who said the dress was out of stock and that I would be given a refund and to send my banking details. Once requested for the refund via message Senara called and inquired the issue. Since there was no follow up called once again early this week and Janani spoke and said Senara will provide my refund. That's it. No refund; no correspondence uptodate. How hard is it to make a bank transfer????? Extreme unprofessionalism. Being a shopper at Mimosa am I disgusted by their business ethics! 5

I paid 8500 for the sandals and do I have to take it myself, a brand new sandal to be precise?!? He literally did not care of my matter. The mimosa name is clearly printed on the sandals. They should not if they can't hold responsibility of the quality of the products. I only bought these sandals trusting the good name of mimosa. Did send them emails and still nothing. Really disappointed. Under what qualifications do you hire people for the stores?? Need more friendly energy!!! (Update: After more than 2 months of purchase) USELESS customer service. Apparently they only care for the online customers. Never respond to an email. Called the store and they told me they'll send it within two days. Now it's been more than a week after the call. I asked for an update!!! Not a fake promise. I'm writing this review because apparently, this is the only way I can get attention. This is my worst shopping experience and I'll never shop from here. I think I have been enough patient. 2 MONTHS and still didn't care for my matter. I just don't get it. WHY can't someone take action!?!? Ravisha"

Mimosa,Awesome collections of ladies wear. Quite chick.
Mimosa,The clean finish and modern denim details create a look that is both timeless and fashion-forward.
Pepper Street,"I recently purchased several clothing items from this shop and had a mixed experience. On the positive side, the hoodies and caps are quite good. They are comfortable, stylish, and seem to be made from better materials compared to other items. However, I found the overall quality of most other clothing items to be lacking. The materials are not up to standard and fade quickly after minimal use. Given the high prices, I expected much better durability and quality. Unfortunately, the price does not match the product quality for most items. While I can recommend the hoodies and caps, I would advise caution with other clothing items if you are seeking quality."
Pepper Street,The color options are vibrant and add a fun pop to any outfit.
Pepper Street,I tried this for the first time. obviously it's perfect. Final outlook was elegant with quality fabrics and good measurements. Highly recommended about clothings üôåüèª Manzab Z

Pepper Street,"Unfortunately, my recent online purchase has taken over two weeks to arrive, and my messages have gone unanswered. I'm disappointed by the no in-store exchange options and the worst customer service. They act like as we are begging for clothesShaheen Rizvi"
Pepper Street,The hoodie feels too bulky and makes me look larger than I am.
Pepper Street,"The oversized style is perfect for a laid-back look, it drapes beautifully without looking sloppy."
Pepper Street,"I went to the store today (16th) to return a T-shirt I bought on theth. The initial size I purchased was XL, but it ended up being too large, so I wanted to swap it for a smaller one. All the other items on the original receipt were fine, just the XL T-shirt was returned . Nonetheless, when I returned the T-shirt for an exchange, the customer service agent claimed that I had worn it and reattached the tags. He asserted that the threading on the label was unlike that on products sold in the store. Thus he believes I have taken the measure of reattaching the labels. I was astonished by his comments. Such inadequate customer service guarantees that this will be my final purchase from this store. Management must ensure that in the future, suitable training and guidance provided on the items sold, particularly regarding the materials used for attaching the tags to prevent this from happening againIan Stephen"

Pepper Street,"""I tried to buy a pair of utility cargo pants from Pepper St. online, but they were all sold out. I reached out to the hotline and got connected with Mr. Rakeeb. Honestly, he's amazing! He took it upon himself to find the pants at a physical outlet and personally arranged delivery for me. The dedication he showed was just out of this world! Hats off to Mr. Rakeeb and the whole Pepper St. team ‚Äì they really went the extra mile. And, of course, the pants fit perfectly and look awesome.

Definitely not recommending this shop to anyone.Nashath"
Pepper Street,"Pepper St. Clothing at One Galle Face Mall offers a great selection of clothing for both ladies and gents. The in-store experience is excellent, with a supportive and understanding staff who make shopping enjoyable. Their collection is stylish, and the quality of the clothing is impressive. However, the online ordering process could use some improvement. There are occasional delays in order processing and responses, and it can be difficult to contact them via mobile at times. If they can enhance their online services, the experience would be perfect."
Pepper Street,"Extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused sir , we‚Äôve always informed that customers need to be provided utmost support but will take required action to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again. Keshan"
Pepper Street,"I bought a polo shirt (t-shirt with a collar) from them. And I barely used it. It was among the highest priced polo shirts they have. When I ordered, it was the right size. After few washes, I can no more wear it because the fabric shrunk and it‚Äôs too short for me to wear now. Will never recommend!üëéüèª Leo"
Pepper Street,The design features subtle branding that adds a modern touch without being too loud.
Pepper Street,"I am extremely disappointed with the online customer service. I had several questions about a product I was interested in purchasing, but getting a response was a nightmare. When I finally did receive a reply, it was generic and didn't address my specific concerns. The representatives seemed uninterested and unhelpful. This experience has made me reconsider shopping here again. A business that doesn't prioritize customer support is not one I can recommend. Games vid"
Pepper Street,Great dress and good material
Pepper Street,"The t-shirt lost its shape after a few washes, making it look worn out."
Pepper Street,The graphic design on this t-shirt is artistic and modern; it instantly elevates any casual outfit.
Pepper Street,"I recently needed help from customer service because the t-shirt I bought was the wrong size. At first, it was hard to get in touch with the team on the phone, but once I did, the experience was great. The team was really nice and always kept me updated. I was impressed by how easy it was to return the t-shirt and get a new one with the coupon provided. My only tip is to maybe let people return or exchange items in the store too. Thanks for making sure I ended up with a t-shirt that fits. Your service is awesome!"
Pepper Street,"Colors faded rapidly after the first wash, which was really disappointing."
Pepper Street,"if you are keen on quality local branded clothing, pepper street is one of the best options. You can find a unique variety of clothing items here. Talking about the pepper street the most attractive thing was the pepper smell inside the shop. That smell is a brilliant usage of marketing strategies. The wall paint also reminds me of the theme pepper."
Pepper Street,"I had a terrible experience with Pepper St. Usually, I wouldn't order clothes online. Instead, I used to go to their physical store and make purchases. On Thursday, I decided to visit their store after checking the opening time. Although they mentioned that they would open atAM, I went aroundPM. However, the store was closed beforePM. So I had to order their original collection via their website, and unfortunately, I received a pair of pants that were too big for me. When I tried to return the pants, I couldn't get through to their customer service. I had to use a friend's Instagram account to contact them since they weren't responding to my calls. I was informed that I couldn't exchange the pants in-store and had to go through their online process, which took several working days to complete. By the time I received my coupon for the exchange, the pants I wanted were already out of stock. I want to warn others not to waste their time and money on Pepper St. and to shop elsewhere for their favourite clothes."
Pepper Street,"I recently shopped at Pepper Street for the first time, and I was really impressed! The material of the butterfly hoodie is excellent and so comfortable. The staff were incredibly helpful in finding the perfect fit for me"
Pepper Street,Do not order online. They are not sending what they promised! Bad choice for online shopping but good one for purchasing at the store! I ordered a black crewneck but they phoned and told black is not available. Then they told a green is available and i told yes for green but they have sent a different color! Not recommending!!! Chose visely....
Pepper Street,One of the most impressive lifestyle clothing brands on the market! Their clothes were top quality and had amazing range of choice. Customer service representative was super friendly and helped me choose clothes from a wide range. Definitely come back here!

Pepper Street,"I recently visited the store and was disappointed with the service. I‚Äôve purchased many clothes from this store in the past because I really like their quality. However, during my recent visit, the cashier took a long time to process the bill for a one Tshirt, which I was okay with, but when I offered cash, she told me to bring change or pay by a card. But I left my card at home. This experience was upsetting; I expected better service, especially when it comes to something as basic as handling change. A polite apology or a better solution from the cashier would have made a big difference. and I hope the management addresses such issues to improve customer service.al waleedh"
Pepper Street,I orderd a tshirtth of april. Today isrd of april. They are not even call me. Tracking number is also not showing.
Pepper Street,Very good stuff and the prices are reasonable . Good collection .
Pepper Street,The pockets are poorly designed and impractical for everyday use.
Pepper Street,"I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received at your store today (24.12.24). I visited to exchange a shirt that was gifted to me. Although I didn‚Äôt have the bill (as it was a gift), the shirt still had its original tag intact. Unfortunately, your team informed me that they could not process the exchange without a receipt. While I understand the importance of store policies, I believe an exception could have been made given that the item was clearly unused and tagged. The rigid approach and lack of flexibility demonstrated by your staff felt unprofessional and did not align with the level of customer care I expected. As the only outlet in Sri Lanka, it‚Äôs crucial to prioritize building a positive reputation for customer service. A more accommodating and customer-focused approach would go a long way in creating a better shopping experience. I hope my feedback will be taken constructively to improve future interactions. Unfortunately, this experience has left me disappointed, and I would hesitate to recommend your store to others."
Pepper Street,"Been purchasing from Pepper street from more than a year now and I‚Äôm glad to say that they haven‚Äôt disappointed me a bit. Use to purchase online from their website But once I started visiting their store at one galle face, it was whole new experience. I would definitely recommend you to visit their store cus it is really eye catching to see the wide variety of products and colours they got and most of all they have a damn friendly staff who assisted me with a smile on their face ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ÄùPleasant people‚Äù and I‚Äôm glad to say that they prioritise customer service on top of all. Highly recommended, do visit their store to get the same experience."
Pepper Street,I recently visited the Pepper St store at OGF and was met with rude staff from the moment I went in. The staff were unhelpful. When I asked something they were not smiling and gave rude replies and the cashier was impatient and careless. I won't be coming back.sameera chathuranga
Pepper Street,"The joggers are versatile, pairing well with both sneakers and casual shoes."
Pepper Street,"The customer service was very poor. I ordered a medium-sized T-shirt, but they sent a small one instead. Immediately upon receiving it, I called to report the issue. They initially instructed me to exchange it at their store in One Galle Face, but when I called to confirm, they told me to send a message on Instagram instead. They lack proper procedures to promptly assist customers. As of now, I haven't received any update from their side, and this situation is causing me trouble. If you're considering buying from them, please think twice because this issue could happen to you as well.nidhursha nidhu"
Pepper Street,"They shrink noticeably after washing, which is very frustrating."
Pepper Street,"Great for layering on cooler days, it never feels too heavy."
Pepper Street,They offer a flattering fit with just the right amount of stretch.
Pepper Street,"Nice clothes and accessories, however tourists need to be careful that the staff do not pocket the change themselves. Having to ask for my change soured the customer experience."
Pepper Street,I don't know what the hype is about. I bought a t shirt for my husband and he wore it only twice. Its color is faded and the t shirt is badly stretched out now. It wasn't a very reasonable price either. You'd honestly expect better quality for their price range.
