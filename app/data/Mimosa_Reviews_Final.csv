Mimosa,Overall Dress,"When I went back to the store, they acted as if I had stolen the blouse, even though I showed them the bill. After being humiliated for hours, I decided to leave the store. However, they eventually took the dress and exchanged it for another one. By then, while I was browsing, everyone was staring at me and my boyfriend like we were thieves. It was such a terrible experience. Despite having a bill worth more than 10,000 LKR, they treated us like this."

Mimosa,Bag,"I have been a loyal customer of Mimosa for many years, consistently shopping at the Bagathale store. However, during my recent visit, I encountered a new store manager whose with big attitude and behavior were extremely disappointing. Unfortunately, I cannot recall his name, but his lack of customer service skills was evident. He behaved as if he owned Mimosa and acted like we were getting the clothes for free. His dismissive attitude and unwillingness to assist customers were unacceptable. When I asked for assistance, he did not respond properly and was very unhelpful. I urge the board of directors to look into this matter seriously. Customer service is crucial, and this manager's behavior does not reflect the values and standards that Mimosa is known for. He needs to treat customers with respect and without any attitude."
Mimosa,Overall Dress,I had a great experience at Mimosa. Specially Shohan was very helpful and friendly. He helped me to select and supported with various clothes related questions. Great customer service !
Mimosa,"Dress, Jumpsuit","Up to date clothing, with good variety of sizes and colours. Amazing dresses and jumpsuits"
Mimosa,Cap,"Clothing items are lovely but it's not for everyone. Pricing is a bit higher than average. Shop is well maintained and clean. Cashier person (tall black guy) treats people according to what and how they're dressed. Don't expect to be welcomed with a warm hello or anything if you're ""under-dressed"". Please learn to treat customers regardless of how and what they wear cuz at the end of the day, people won't be purchasing things if they're treated like trash. Will not visit this place again."

Also most importantly what I love about is they got some very unique colour palette. Amazing collection of pieces. But the only thing is they drop their collection online after all pieces are sold out. It‚Äôs not much upto date. So they really wanna do in-store and online purchase separately.

So it has been like two weeks as I went to Kandy to gift it to her and then realised it's larger. So needed just a size exchange to a smaller one. The guys at the cashier refused. I didn't have the bill as it was bought as a gift., but had the credit card payment receipt with me with the details. The price tag was attached.If it was from any other place I could have get it exchanged without any issue. Also if they have such strict exchange policy they should display it in the shop as other similar stores have.Never gonna buy something from them again. Bad customer service. 3"

Mimosa,Denim,"I‚Äôm a regular client for one & half years . Usually I buy my costumes & all denims from Mimosa , I received an Invitation fro One Galle Face Branch Opening, But when I went today to exchange my items there was a new girl @the reception, she was really rude to me , she didn‚Äôt respect me & even I went with one of my friend , she was completely disappointed of this situation. She didn‚Äôt even call me Miss ,, she was showing he big face to us, When I ask her to give me a credit note on my bill she rejected & asked me to bring my items again when I come to purchase next time & I had to request her couple of times to give me a credit note on it . She made couple of calls to a manager or someone then agreed to give me a credit note. She was really really rude & I was totally despondent. When I leave the place & until I leave the place from cab , she came out side with other 2 girls who were working there , & they were looking at us & they were talking something, I felt that they were scolding us because they were looking at my cab directly. Usually I contact with Dilshan & Avishka at the store, Unfortunately they were not there today . They have good manners & they do good customer care service& very supportive , you better not keep people who don‚Äôt know how to respect to their client 10"

Highly disappointed with their online service. 2

Mimosa,Frock,"The frocks are perfect for special occasions, yet casual enough for a stylish brunch."
Mimosa,Bag,"Well the exchange process here is very easy and smooth . I have encountered several situations where I ordered wrong size and I could easily get it exchanged physically at the store thanks to the staff at Bagathale rd store and the OGF. And compared to most of the leading SL clothing brands, their materials and fabrics are better than the others. Sajani Ratnayake 1 review"

Mimosa,Overall Dress,"Everybody love the unique styles and the affordability! But recently the dress prices doesn‚Äôt match with the quality ü•≤ I bought a dress last from their website and the buttons / fabric were cheap! It‚Äôs better if you visit their store and buy rather than shopping online and their customer service is horrible , had to beg once to return a damaged item ! I won‚Äôt ever shop again with them ! 7 Laura Mart√≠n"

Mimosa,Cap,Horrible Horrible customer service. Placed an online order for a dress on the 6th of Nov 2022 expecting it for a function by the 11th. Fully paid. Untill I called there was no correspondence. Once called the first receiver said the dress was dispatched then recalled her statement. Next spoke to someone called Dulani who said the dress was out of stock and that I would be given a refund and to send my banking details. Once requested for the refund via message Senara called and inquired the issue. Since there was no follow up called once again early this week and Janani spoke and said Senara will provide my refund. That's it. No refund; no correspondence uptodate. How hard is it to make a bank transfer????? Extreme unprofessionalism. Being a shopper at Mimosa am I disgusted by their business ethics! 5
Mimosa,Cap,"Outstanding Customer Service! I had an amazing experience with [Customer Care Person Mr Shohan from Mimosa clothing They were incredibly helpful, patient, and professional throughout the entire process. I reached out with an issue regarding specific issue, e.g., an order, product inquiry, or return and they went above and beyond to ensure everything was resolved quickly and smoothly. What stood out most was their attention to detail and genuine care for making sure I was satisfied. They not only addressed my concern but also offered helpful suggestions that made my shopping experience even better. Their friendly demeanor and excellent communication skills truly made a difference. It‚Äôs rare to find such dedicated and knowledgeable customer service representatives these days, and Shohan is a shining example of how it should be done. Thanks to their help, I‚Äôll definitely continue shopping with Mimosa and recommending it to others.‚ù§Ô∏è"

Mimosa,"Bag, Belt, Sandals","Very poor customer care. I recently purchased a pair sandals from Mimosa. Only after two times use the belt broke so I went to the bagatale store. The man in the reception told me that they don't hold responsiblity regarding this since they purchase from another company and to take it to the repair shop myself. I paid 8500 for the sandals and do I have to take it myself, a brand new sandal to be precise?!? He literally did not care of my matter. The mimosa name is clearly printed on the sandals. They should not if they can't hold responsibility of the quality of the products. I only bought these sandals trusting the good name of mimosa. Did send them emails and still nothing. Really disappointed. Under what qualifications do you hire people for the stores?? Need more friendly energy!!! (Update: After more than 2 months of purchase) USELESS customer service. Apparently they only care for the online customers. Never respond to an email. Called the store and they told me they'll send it within two days. Now it's been more than a week after the call. I asked for an update!!! Not a fake promise. I'm writing this review because apparently, this is the only way I can get attention. This is my worst shopping experience and I'll never shop from here. I think I have been enough patient. 2 MONTHS and still didn't care for my matter. I just don't get it. WHY can't someone take action!?!? Ravisha"
