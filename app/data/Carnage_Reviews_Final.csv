Their collection seamlessly blends style and functionality, making it a go-to choice for everyday wear and casual outings. What truly sets Carnage apart is their attention to detail and the quality of their materials, ensuring both comfort and durability.

Carnage,Overall Dress,"Last week, my friend placed an online order for me from Sri Lanka but accidentally entered the wrong address. We immediately contacted your support team via email and I also called them same day morning to rectify the issue. I was advised to send another email with the correct address, which I did, and requested confirmation once the change was made.

Unfortunately, I never received a confirmation, and the parcel was picked up by DHL with the incorrect address. I had to reach out to DHL directly to request the address change once again, which added unnecessary stress and complication.

While I have always respected Carnage for its quality, I believe there is room for improvement in your customer service.

I hope this feedback helps improve future interactions :) 2 Desh Perera"

Carnage,Shirt,"I recently purchased a shirt from Carnage, and I have to say, I'm impressed. Not only does the shirt fit perfectly, but it also magically attracts compliments from strangers. I wore it to the grocery store and people were literally stopping me in the aisles to tell me how awesome my shirt was. I even got a marriage proposal from the cashier. So, if you're looking for a shirt that will make you the talk of the town, look no further than this Carnageü§© Chamini Alwis"

Carnage,Overall Dress,"Carnage: A Disappointing Detour
I was once a die-hard fan of Carnage. Their edgy designs and unique style resonated with me, and I proudly wore their clothes. However, my unwavering loyalty has taken a significant hit.

The quality of Carnage's products has drastically declined. What used to be durable, stylish pieces has transformed into cheaply made items that barely survive a few washes. It's disheartening to pay a premium price for clothing that falls apart so quickly.

To make matters worse, the customer service has plummeted. Gone are the days of friendly and helpful staff. Now, customers are met with indifference and a complete lack of care. Trying to exchange a faulty item or seek assistance with an order has become a frustrating ordeal.

It‚Äôs truly sad to see a once-loved brand deteriorate in such a manner. I hope Carnage takes notice of these issues and takes steps to rectify them. Until then, I'll be looking for new brands that value both their products and customers. 4"

Carnage,Shorts,"I visited the store on February 21, 2025, for the first time. While the store's aesthetic is appealing, the layout presented navigational challenges due to an unconventional and confusing arrangement of merchandise.

Unfortunately, the overall shopping experience fell short of expectations. The store lacked my required size (Large) in the desired t-shirts and (Small) in the intended shorts. Furthermore, despite observing approximately seven staff members, none offered assistance which is disappointing. Thought Carnage would do better.

Ended up buying two shorts (but not in the color I wanted) and will comment on the quality/durability after use. farhath fazni"

Carnage,Shirt,"Prepare for a fashion experience that's larger than life and funnier than your uncle's dance moves at a wedding! The Carnage Desire Oversize Tee is the ultimate statement piece for those who want to rock a shirt that's more spacious than a first-class airplane seat. It's so roomy, you could fit a family of squirrels inside and still have space for a mini-fridge! Not only does it provide excellent coverage for a hot dog eating contest, but it's also perfect for hiding that extra slice of pizza you want to sneak into a movie theater. With its vibrant colors and enough fabric to make a quilt, this tee is guaranteed to turn heads and cause laughter-induced bellyaches.
