GFlock,Overall Dress,"New Over the past year, I have placed multiple orders for GFlock clothing, but unfortunately, my experiences have been disappointing. The first time, I was informed that the dress I ordered had been discontinued due to a factory defect and was asked to choose a replacement. However, I was surprised to find that the same dress was still available for purchase on their website. The second time, I placed an order, but even after a month, the dress has yet to be delivered. Once again, I was told that the item had defects and needed to be addressed at the factory. This is not the level of service one expects, especially when purchasing a dress that costs around , rupees! Update: After waiting for more than a month I was told that the dress I ordered and paid for is unavailable. The customer service agent previously told that they will contact me after the dress became available again. But, today after waiting for more than a month I contacted them again and then only I was told that the dress is not available. They didn't even bother to call me. Such poor communication and horrible customer service! Dulashini Wanniarachchi review¬∑ photo"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"I have been a loyal customer of GFLOCK for many years, Consistently shopping at the palawatta and then delkanda branch. First, I wanted to make a special note of appreciation to ENOSH for helping me out with an exceptional service at every time.. Thanks a bunch for helping me through the process and for the support of him only I used to visit GFLOCK Colpetty branch recently. Elegant architecture, very calm and beautiful place where you can roam free for what you are looking for . I really loved the environment inside,Two stories are filled with unique collection of dresses etc. Look forward to shop more with GFLOCKüíó‚Ä¶CHEERS.. Dulashini Wanniarachchi"

Thank you Gflock team keep up your good work"
GFlock,Overall Dress,Clothing shop with modern and unique designs. But if you want to buy their new designs better you go there on the day of release. Initially they mainly targeted the women‚Äôs clothing but now they have introduced men‚Äôs as well. Two storied clothing store with ground floor for women and first floor for men. Less selection for men comparatively. Have common fitting rooms. But may be not adequate in busy days specially when there are sales. Staff is friendly and helpful. Few vehicles can be parked in front of the shop and there‚Äôs a separate car park near by with enough space. Kalana Prasanka Kalana Prasanka Imaa review
GFlock,"Denim, Frock, Shirt, Shoes","There is a wide variety of clothes for women and men. No items for children. Usual prices are above Rs., for women. Ground floor has ladies items which consists of sections for shoes, denims, office wear, Cotton clothes and casual items as well (T, shirts, blouses and frocks). Most of the ladies items are made of Georgette which is less suitable for a country like Sri Lanka. Their denims are the best and not so rough like other denims. So i would highly recommend GFlock for denims. As a CSR initiative, they give away plants for free. Parking facilities are very limited. Therefore, will have to park on the Galle Road. The entrance Menswear Keshini Dias Denims section Keshini Dias Shanika Nilukshi"
GFlock,Denim,"I ordered from GFlock Global, but the sizes were wrong. I usually wear size , but their size was completely different. When I complained, they said it couldn't be wrong, which was frustrating. I compared it with my new denim, and they still insisted it was right. Don't buy from GFlock Global if you're not in Sri Lanka. Very disappointed. Shanika Nilukshi Shanika Nilukshi Shanika Nilukshi Shanika Nilukshi"
GFlock,Overall Dress,They are having awesome collection of dresses. The staffs are very friendly. Its well organized. Mostly all sizes are available. Sometimes its hard to find larger sizes. The prices are bit high. Kalyani Vikineswaran Kalyani Vikineswaran Chawana Jayawardana (EYL)

GFlock,Overall Dress,"I recently visited this store for the first time and was impressed by the wide range of office and casual clothes for ladies. The selection is stylish. The staff were very helpful. You can order the clothes through their website, which offers the convenience of online shopping with various payment methods including Mintpay. One downside is the limited parking in front of the shop. However, there is a public parking area about meters away on the right side which helps mitigate this issue."
GFlock,Overall Dress,No much collection for gents and no waiting area. Parking is super hazel here. Only vehicles parking at time and they announce once you block with other vehicles. This is super annoying . My wife is loving place since she has items to choose from Isura Amarasinghe Isura Amarasinghe Isura Amarasinghe Sharm Narnia
GFlock,Overall Dress,Unique collections ideal for teens and very chick type ladies and girls... Madu Ileperuma

Tried calling all the stores and the hotline and even tried contacting them through social media but no response!! Even the small businesses have good customer care services than you!

GFlock,Overall Dress,The Kollupitiya branch has a very good collection of dresses now. The store is neatly organized. Some items are unreasonably pricey and there is not much of a collection of jeans either. You can definitely find a dress for an event. Malmi Saparamadu
GFlock,Overall Dress,"I had a horrible experience with GFlock's online service. I ordered an outfit and returned it to their Colpetty outlet on 17th August for an exchange. Despite following up multiple times, I never received my exchange code. Their customer service is non-existent no one picks up calls, and there is zero communication. It's clear they don‚Äôt care about their online customers. I‚Äôve been left frustrated and without a solution. If you‚Äôre considering shopping online with GFlock, think twice‚Äîtheir service is inefficient and unreliable. Save yourself the headache and shop elsewhere. Binu Lorenzuhewa"
GFlock,Overall Dress,Gflock Pelawatta offers an excellent selection of clothing. The staff are friendly and go out of their way to serve each customer in a personalized way. I must especially mention Arun and Rismina who have been helpful and outstandingly supportive in making every shopping experience delightful. Wishing them and Gflock all success. Blessings. Tharindu Wickremasinghe
GFlock,Overall Dress,"According to my wife, they have plenty of different varieties of good quality clothes. Price is average to above average. Customer service is average. The place is spacious enough. But there weren't enough benches or chairs to sit and wait. Ashmi de Silva"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"Went last week and there were some glaring issues . The music is way too loud which made for a terrible shopping experience. If you spend more than - minutes in the shop you might actually go crazy . The sales people/assistants were very intimidating and were too busy flirting with each other to actually help people . Most items are extremely over priced and was very low quality - most items had make up/ dirty stains and were damaged/ stitching had come off. . The sizing is way off and lacks uniformity - I could wear sizes ,, and it was very confusing and time consuming to find the proper size. . The items look different to the ones posted on their website - so be mindful when you are searching for the same item in store. Overall do not recommend as it is not worth the price you are paying. This is too bad because I actually liked this store. Inosh Perera"

GFlock,Frock,"I went to delkanda branch to exchange a frock. It has a original price tag. At that time bill was not in my hand because someone has gigifted for me that frock, it was too big in size for me. Unfortunately they asked a bill or even date of purchase. This is branded shop and Im a good customer of them. I dont know why they asked bill even original tags was there. Other branded shops ODEL,MONDY , AKIRA they didn't asked bill if item has it original price tag. Please think twice when you are shopping like is classy shopping center. I gave my frock to them to do something as they whish , because I dont want a frock which is not fitted for me. Price was Rs. .. We are very disappointed on GFlocküò° Charlotte Roche"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"Queued for minutes, how can it be so difficult to scan clothes for payment?! Unreal waste of time Bhagya Dahanayake review"
GFlock,Overall Dress,Quite a popular local brand for office and casual wear. Parking can be challenging during peak traffic hours.
GFlock,Overall Dress,I frequently visit this place and they have a vast variety of quality and unique clothing specially for ladies. The prices too are reasonable. Parking at this place is limited and difficult at sometimes. Nuwan Kanchana
GFlock,Overall Dress,"I've been a loyal customer of GFlock since they started, but this experience was really disappointing. I strongly recommend not buying their clothes online. Nimesha Perera"
GFlock,Denim,"I have been purchasing clothes from GFlock since they have started and have never disappointed me. The designers have good fashion sense, and the quality of the materials has always been good. I have a denim that i have been wearing for about / years nowüôÉ ( may be more because it's from their first denim collection). Physical store is good, and they have ample trying on rooms as well. Online purchasing is easy, and exchange is quite convenient. Shiwanka Wimalaweera"
GFlock,Overall Dress,Great clothing store with modern designs. Mens section need more cloth choices. Very impressed with the free plant giveaway initiative Sanjeewa Marasinghe Sanjeewa Marasinghe p b
GFlock,Overall Dress,I bought a dress online and I cannot where it because it's hanging from the waist. You can't even alter it. This is the first and last time I am buying anything from G- Flock. Everyone else too shouldn't be wasting your money on their garments. They don't care about the customer for sure.üò™ oshan
GFlock,Overall Dress,Not recommended. Visited today. Surprised with the disgusting service. None of sales persons was interested to help except men sales persons. Disgusting service of fitting room specially from female security guard. Blaming customers to fitting clothes and discouraging clients to fit on. No manners and discipline at Front line security. Limited stocks with less varieties. No seating arrangements. Saliya Muthuwaruna de Silva
GFlock,Overall Dress,They have trendy clothes for women and gents. (Upstairs for gents) Poor customer service. No waiting area. Parking is limited (enough for - vehicles) Thilina Cooray
GFlock,Overall Dress,"Clothes are very good, latest fashion and quality. Don't like the fit on experience at all. On ladies fit on male are not allowed to go and see their partner's dress up. Ladies have to come outside and show while all others looking at. But they allow their male staff to walk through the ladies fit on. This is not acceptable at all. Very very bad experience... Kithmini Nonis review"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"Amazing collection of clothing with decent parking given the location of the shop. However, if you happen to be on the plus size end of the spectrum for guys, they may not necessarily have clothing to fit your needs. The staff are friendly and very helpful and the shop is beautifully arranged. Ashoka Perera"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"I recently had the opportunity to shop at GFlock, a luxury clothing store, and I was thoroughly impressed. The store had a wide variety of high-end designer clothing and accessories for both men and women. The staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, offering styling advice and helping me find the perfect pieces. The store itself was beautifully designed and had a very upscale feel. I was particularly impressed with the quality of the clothing - every piece felt like it was made with care and attention to detail. I left the store feeling very satisfied with my purchases and would highly recommend GFlock to anyone looking for luxury fashion. Chalani"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"To be frank Its over priced. They have a good style collection but they are leveraging it too much. , - , for a normal dress is too much. U can buy same design and quality products in neils and other new designers shops that growing in the market. On the positive note the customer service is good and they update there styles frequently. sandani jayarathne"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"Great place for women's fashion, well designed clothes at reasonable prices. Not cheap. However, the men's line is average, lacks variety and imagination. Perhaps because the men's line is still very new. It's a very busy shop anytime of day. Limited parking outside the premises, but they do have a fair amount of parking about a close distance away. My teenage daughter and my middle aged wife : ) both seem to love the place. Highly Recommended for women. Sandun Mendis"
GFlock,Overall Dress,Favourite place to buy dresses. I used to buy online for several years now. Always deliver good quality stuff. But visiting the store in person has lot of difficulties. Limited parking space is the major negative point. Also it takes ages to get to the fit on room. Understandable since there are so many people shopping there. Buddhi Lekamwasam
GFlock,Overall Dress,The variety of clothes is good but they are overly expensive. The staff is very rude they didn't even let us exchange clothes saying unbelievable reasons. Manori ‚ÄúRimona‚Äù Dharmadasa
GFlock,Denim,Great place if you wear size 8UK even some XL sizes also can be found. Denims are go to item as their denims are fitting well. Fit on staff is polite and there are many fit on rooms available and it is really convenient when it is crowded. The lightning is a bit dark inside however you can find something to buy when you go there. Men's section is also available but not popular as ladies'. Great shopping experience! Parking is limited in front of the shop but available near the Commercial bank. Sameera Withanage
GFlock,Overall Dress,I love the clothes here. But there service is really poor. I had a address change ( from Sri Lanka to overseas) however its been over a month now still they haven‚Äôt been able to get it collected from the courier service and ship it overseas. Yohara Ranasinghe
GFlock,Overall Dress,"Really cute clothes, and have sales going on as well. But the music is too loud and has headache-inducing beats. Honestly dampens the experience. Praween Weerasingham"

Dinu Abeygunasekara"
GFlock,Frock,"Good place for girls. The best thing here is the uniqueness. No baby items. Even though now there's a new section for gents, there's no good selection. Most of There Frocks are from the same wet look rough materials. There are some good quality blouses but I think it's little over priced as we can find the same quality things from outside. isuru abeywickrama"

GFlock,Overall Dress,This place has a nice vibe in it. The staff is friendly and helpful. It is well organized. You can choose different varieties of clothing here.

GFlock,Overall Dress,"Currently going through a renovation, so the main entrance is closed. You have to go through a temporary side entrance. Nice selection of women's clothes. It was kind of crowded during the time we visited. Clean place. Atmosphere could have a small update, but not much to complain about. Reasonable prices, when there is a sale going on, prices may drop down to around to Rs. To the Life"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"One of the good places in Colombo to do the cloth shopping. Has a good collection of dresses, jeans, office wear and other casual wear. Always crowded. The Quality of clothes is satisfactory. However the staff members are not that friendly. Chinthaka Upendra"
GFlock,Overall Dress,They do have some nice clothing but they don't keep much in stock. You need to buy asap if you like something. You can't postpone for next time. They always run out of sizes üòî Amanda Fernando
GFlock,Overall Dress,I‚Äôm giving one star because there was one guy who didn‚Äôt do his job properly. I wanted to know something about a dress but he didn‚Äôt know how to talk to a customer. He was a fair person with specs.He might‚Äôve thought that he‚Äôs the owner of the company. VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Those kind of people should be fired!!!! H Kavindya
GFlock,Overall Dress,Worst online shopping experience. It was for a birthday (I ordered one week before the birthday) but now it‚Äôs a week passed the birthday and they haven‚Äôt yet delivered it.

GFlock,Overall Dress,Best place to shop ! Ample space and they got the most trendy designs! They are established for women wear but recently they have expanded to men wear as well. Prices are bit high end but actually worth it! Ramila Udalagama
GFlock,Overall Dress,"A popular store for lady's clothes including great dresses. It has parking for about vehicles, but since the store is on Galle road, you can usually park your vehicle somewhere close by on Galle road. This is a single story building so is accessible even by a wheelchair. Considering the comments of the ladies I know, I think this is one of the better stores in Colombo. Yasas"
GFlock,Overall Dress,Awesome collection and each one has different sizes to choose from. Made out high quality material. Not so crowded. Needless to say prices are a bit high but it's a bang for the buck. My wife really liked the dresses she had chosen. By the way all are Made in Sri Lanka. Go for it. ‚ò∫ Sameera Samarasekara

GFlock,Overall Dress,Quality ladies and gents cloths. The prices are a bit expensive for the quality of the products they offer. Especially the ladies footwear. They release a new collection every Monday online and you can even shop via their website. The store is spacious and well arranged. They rarely add new styles in the gents section. The staff here uses to he friendly and helpful when they started. But the current staff rarely helps the customers. GF Mgt should focus more on improving the customer service. Bamba Zillah
GFlock,Overall Dress,One of the best place to find your formal and casual attire. I find the clothing very durable and very chic. Reasonable prices and very friendly staff.

GFlock,Overall Dress,"Returned an online order on 18th November. The courier company has delivered it to the Piliyandala address (as given by the hotline of gflock) on 21st of November. More than a week has passed and the customer care claims they haven‚Äôt received any package. Since you are a company you are acting careless to process an order. You have received the returned package and my original payment as well. And I lost almost /-, for nothing! Shame on your careless attitude towards customers üò°üò°üò°. WhatsApp support people also have no idea and they aren‚Äôt even willing to monitor a complaint. They just leave on read, when asked for an update on the return. Sandamini Rajapakse"

GFlock,Frock,Worst online stall ever. It‚Äôs more than month Since I returned my items. No feedback until I called them today. And they said they will dispatch it today. Funny thing is they only send it for quality inspection after we make pay for the item. And that means they make us to pay for the items which are not good for sale. That‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt expect from gflock. Also once purchased they don‚Äôt allow us to exchange. Only a size exchange is allowed and if the size are not available then it‚Äôs over. You have to use the frocks that you purchased by paying in thousands may be to make pillow cases.because they don‚Äôt refund/give stall credit or allow us to but another product from that. They just said if the sizes are not available from the same design then they can‚Äôt do anything about it. I‚Äôm a regular online buyer and sad to say this is the only place with such a poor customer care!! Guys don‚Äôt get trapped in to their online stall where they take your money first by showing poor quality garments which are not suitable for sale and they they won‚Äôt allow you to exchange or refund.

GFlock,Overall Dress,This is their new outlet located in Pelawatta. Has a fairly decent range of clothing/dresses but comparatively less than the one at Colpetty. Certain dresses had no sizes in store. I felt that the store was kind of overstaffed (most of them staying at the ground floor) while only one staff member was in the first floor. There are about fit-on rooms ( in the ground floor and in the first floor). Items are somewhat pricey. They have a range of clothing for gents as well.

I was in a hurry to buy a dress for the next day's function, and I entered the shop at the last minute, as it was about to close. However, the staff offered their help without being overbearing and opened the shop till I found a suitable dress for me., and they took the time to understand my style preferences and even suggested a few options that I hadn't considered but ended up loving. Their product knowledge was impressive‚Äîthey knew exactly which sizes and styles would work best for me, and they made sure I was comfortable and satisfied with my choices. The checkout process was swift and easy, and I enjoyed all the help they offered. You rarely encounter such friendly and elegant service. I will definitely comeback and recommend this store to everyone. Kudos to the excellent staff, especially Bhawani and Nadeera, for making my shopping experience so joyful! Tharushi Nethmini review"

GFlock,Overall Dress,"I am writing to express my disappointment regarding my recent visit to your Pelawatte store. As a loyal GFLOCK customer for the past ten years, I have always appreciated the quality of your products and the service provided. However, my experience during my latest visit was notably unsatisfactory. On this occasion, I felt that the staff's attitude towards me was less than welcoming, and their behavior made me feel as though I was a burden. While I understand that first impressions can be influenced by appearance, I would like to emphasize the importance of treating all customers with respect and courtesy, regardless of their presentation on a given day. I kindly request that you address this matter with your staff. It would be beneficial for them to receive training on maintaining a professional demeanor and ensuring that all customers feel valued and respected. Judging a customer by their appearance is not conducive to a positive shopping experience and does not align with the high standards of customer service that I have come to expect from GFLOCK. I hope that future visits to your store will reflect the level of service that has earned my loyalty over the years. Anuradha HPT review¬∑ photo"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"I was really disappointed with the fitting rooms. I went with my girlfriend, and she tried on a dress. The security lady near the fitting room didn't allow me to check how the dress looked on her. What's the point of having fitting rooms if we can't see how the outfit fits? NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL! Vidhusha Gunasekar review"
GFlock,"Bag, Dress",This was the first time I went to their battaramulla store. It was smaller than expected. They had a limited selection of dresses. The staff is helpful and overall a very pleasant experience. It has a few parking spots upfront which is convenient. It wasn't very crowded like their kolpity showroom. chamila kotambage review
GFlock,Overall Dress,"Gflock is my favourite local clothing brand. And the Pelawatte branch is my go to branch for all my clothing purchases. The staff is very friendly and supportive. I usually go through their page n reserve whatever pieces I wish to purchase. Their staff of course my special thanks goes to Kevin since years n years he‚Äôs giving a superb service, helps to reserve the pieces just one txt away. And of course I grab them on my earliest. Have to mention that we do not have much space inside the store but im okay with that as long as I do selection on their page n visit the store to put on n buy them.. since i do not have much time to go through a store physically.

GFlock,Overall Dress,"Very disappointed about the gflock online service & also the delivery service.I have ordered some sale items on 13th july.After days I emailed them no reply so, I talked to the online customer service, then they told me couldnt complete my order bcuz items hadn't available at that moment.their reason were due to the technical problem,even not available items are showing on the website.But they hadn't inform it until I ask them.I replaced items again & no response in days.I have to call again & again by myself to check my order.after all of that, today (23rd july) morning a delivery guy called me & I clearly mentioned the direction.Its not difficult.But in the evening when I call him he said he couldnt find the address üòñ.so he'll come tomorrowüôÑ..not going to buy again your products.please consider about the customers orders.

GFlock,Overall Dress,"I recently had the pleasure of interacting with Kevin, Arun, and the team at GFlock, and I must say their customer service was exceptional. They were incredibly professional, knowledgeable about their products, and always approachable. They efficiently addressed all my queries, ensuring a smooth transaction. Moreover, they resolved a minor issue promptly, demonstrating their commitment to customer satisfaction. Overall, my experience was highly positive, and I would recommend GFlock to anyone seeking outstanding service."" Kalana Prasanka"
GFlock,Overall Dress,Spacious Gflock branch. Has a good collection. Staff is friendly and helpful. Has got clothes for both men and women. Less selection for men. Kalana Prasanka
GFlock,Overall Dress,"They do have a nice collection of women's clothing and I used to be a regular customer. However there was a power cut while I was there last week and gflock pelawatte had no backup power source, I waited there for about 15min and left the store. I would have expected better from a local high-end store like them. Utterly disappointed. Vindya Yapa"
GFlock,Overall Dress,"Last week, I visited the Pelawatta branch of Gflock and tried on a number of outfits. And even though I frequent the store, they assumed I was trying to steal clothing. Whenever I visit, I usually make a purchase of clothing. I would advise my friends not to shop at this store and they lost a regular customer as well. They also provided extremely poor and disappointing customer service. They have no idea how to handle clients. I would advise anyone not to use this Pelawatta branch.Very disappointed‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è Mirko Kavisha"

GFlock,Overall Dress,Opened relatively recently this outlet at the heart of Pelawatte has had great success. Two floors of clothing both mens and ladies are available in a contemporary atmosphere. While their selection is not extensive there is a sense of style with chic smart dressing options. They had a surprising good selection of linen wear. There is ample parking at the rear of the property so don't stress to park upfront. Staff is friendly and helpful. L√†l L

GFlock,Overall Dress,"Gflock is a modern, ladies and gents wear shop located in Pelawatta. Great location with parking and three storied building but inside is little cramped out. selection is very good, helpful staff and trendy music. ## Update - They allow in store shopping now but be aware you can't fit on and check clothes before you buy due to COVID- situation. After you buy no cash refund but possible to exchange. Nimz Diaries"
GFlock,Overall Dress,Shopped there feb 20th and lost my earring. I‚Äôm sure it felt while I‚Äôm trying dresses. Try to call same day and today many times but every time I tried put on hold for while and automatically disconnected. I tried other locations too it was the same. If the phone lines not working why it‚Äôs display on websites. Please upload working number. I have no complaint other than that Very friendly helpful staff. Upeksha Maduwanthi

GFlock,Overall Dress,"Location : Branch in New Parliment Road. battaramulla. Multi storayed building wth each floor dedicated for Men, Women and kids. New and fasionable clothing. Mid to high range in price. Uniq collection specially for women. Service is ok, but can improve. Parking only available on the street without dedicated security. Counters are fast and active. Well if you want access to the changing room there is a bit of a wait. Overall good place to shop for the whole family KC Sirimanna"
GFlock,Overall Dress,They have to the worst exchange policy.when you buy some garments online you should get the chance of exchange 8f the customer is unhappy of the product.this can be very likely to happen as customers order just sent some model wearing it. GFlock do give exchange facility but it is very unrealistic for customers. everything happens through courier services. they should be implement the method used by odel.any customer regardless of online or in-store can walk into their exchange counter and get the replacement.
