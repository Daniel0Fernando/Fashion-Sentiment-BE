Emerald,Overall Dress,Superb quality. Highly recommended. But haven’t good design collection.
Emerald,Shirt,"Visited today and bought some shirts. Good collection of shirts available here. But customer service is bit low as I noticed today. When I was entering, the shop is empty but no one came and ask me anything but I had to call someone and asked. I feel the customer service is also should be in a best quality as their goods. I hope this feedback will help Emerald to improve their customer service. Cheers"
Emerald,"Pants, Shirt, Shorts","Loved the store. Such a huge variety to choose from. Pants, shorts, socks, casual t shirts , formal shirts, ties, cufflinks and tie pins, underwear. even perfume! I will never shop anywhere else for men other than at the store. Very helpful staff. Safni Ahmed"
Emerald,Shirt,"I visited on a rainy day, completely soaked, but that didn't stop me from shopping. The staff were patient and helpful, offering great customer service throughout my visit. They had a nice collection of shirts, trousers, and T-shirts, and I appreciated having the freedom to choose and try on whatever I liked. Even though the weather was bad, I was really happy I decided to shop there. Ushani Muthumudali"

Emerald,Shirt,"Brought  pairs of short sleeves shirts ( cm). The shirts priced fairly reasonable however, some of the stock are quite old so be vigilant. One of the shirt which I adore the most has burnt crease. Staff minded their own work and didn't bother us at all we took our time in selecting. The place is pretty basic, no A/C nor accepting card payments. The outlet is near Elvitgala Mw, about  m away from the Kirimandala Mw junction. Finding a good parking spot maybe challenging fortunately we went around .pm on a Sunday (hardly anyone on road). DThiral A  Chamara Nanayakkarawasam"
Emerald,Shirt,"This is a good place if you are looking for a quality shirt for a bargain price. Obviously, the products are not in the best of the condition but they are well worth the price tag. They have a limited range of products and sizes. The sales person is super helpful and polite. You can brows through the available options as much as you like. It recommend that you check the products carefully and read the tags before making a purchase. Some of the tags contain information about the defects in the product. All in all, it is a good place to visit while you are shopping for shirts. jayali gunawardena"
Emerald,Shirt,"You can buy good formal shirts and trousers from this store for half price what they are sold in other retail shops.

The clothing product quality is good but for online orders and services, i don't recommend EMERALD to you, you will BE DISAPPOINTED ❌❌. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS WORST❌❌  T San"
Emerald,Cap,This company is ignoring public complaints about the noise they make throughout the day. They are so selfish and not thinking about the people who live nearby. Very sad to say that we experience such bad qualities of emerald management.

Emerald,Cap,Products are good. But the sales people are one of the most unmoving I have seen anywhere -even though it’s more or less the same case in all the SWX stores. It gives the impression that the management doesn’t treat the staff enough so they are not bothered about the sales. Or they are not the staff at all but sons and relatives of the owner.

Emerald,"Shirt, T-shirt","Lovely t-shirts and linen shirts for Men, fell in love with their round neck cotton t shirts and linen shirts! Emerald and Leonardo are their brands and they have a new floral range for men. I got vouchers for a gift, plastic cards in denominations, cool idea ,don't you think. Arshad Muhammed"
Emerald,Cap,Products are good. But the sales people are one of the most unmoving I have seen anywhere -even though it’s more or less the same case in all the SWX stores. It gives the impression that the management doesn’t treat the staff enough so they are not bothered about the sales. Or they are not the staff at all but sons and relatives of the owner. Ralph Fernando
Emerald,Shirt,A perfect place for shirts! Various designs for corporate & casual wear. The staff is very polite and supportive. The showroom is little congested due to its limited space but still the shirt selection will make you satisfied despite the congestion. Mohamed Nazar Mohideen

Emerald,Shirt,"They have excellent collection of formal wear for men. They have shirt brands such as Emerald, Crocodile, and Array. The store is medium size, nevertheless the place is neatly layed out. They have fit on rooms as well. They prices are almost comparable to other shops in the Colombo. The service is really good, they have genie payment method as well. The parking space is limited tough,  cars can be parked. Overall a good men's clothing store situated in Colombo.

Emerald,Shirt,Definitely one scene year I visit here. Because I buy all of my office shirts from here. Specially they have two brands  emerald second crocodile. I go with the grand emerald because they fit to my size. When I went there this year it was an amazing feeling. Because their staff is so helpful. I don't know in you that I was going to buy a lot anyways there was that guy he was helping us for more than  hours. Without him we could not find some colours. Osho after buying some trousers they were small problem with the length and they did its adjustments for me.  Samuel Poologasingam
