Dilly & Carlo,Overall Dress,It has been almost 2 weeks since I placed the online order from Carlo but I haven't received it yet. I tried to contact them in different ways more than 10 times but I couldn't reach a proper person to talk about this. All I could reach was the guard room who doesn't even know how to speak to the customer with some respect. It was supposed to be my New year clothes and I don't need it if I don't receive it before New year. I need a money refund and don't know whom to even reach. Very disappointed about their online ordering system and customer service. DON'T OREDER FROM THEM ONLINE. 5
Dilly & Carlo,Shorts,"Stumbled upon this store sometime back and I’ve grown to like it to the point almost every piece of clothing that I own is from them. In my opinion they provide value for money as I’ve been wearing a lot of their products for a very long time and they still are in good shape. I absolutely love their linen range, specially the linen shorts because they’re as comfy as a pair of shorts can get. I’ve literally started to second guess myself whenever I have to wear jeans or any other heavy piece of clothing after trying out their linen products. All in all, they’ve grown to be quite a good store to buy very unique, fashionable and comfortable stuff to wear. uttara peiris"
Dilly & Carlo,"Shirt, Top","They have a good collection of men's casual shirts but the prices are on the higher side. I've visited the shop as well as purchased a few items online. The experience so far has been good regarding the quality of the products and their customer service. I found some products not worth the mentioned price due to low-quality materials used in those. If they are maintaining a premium brand, I expect all of their items to be top quality. 2"

Dilly & Carlo,"Dress, Shirt","I have been a loyal customer of Dilly and Carlo since 2011, consistently choosing your brand for both formal and casual wear. My preferred branches have always been and K , and I was quite disappointed when the latter closed down. Over the past few months, I have visited your and Mall branches over ten times specifically to purchase white shirts and trousers. Unfortunately, on every occasion, I was informed by the staff that the new stock had not yet arrived. This recurring issue has been extremely frustrating and disappointing, as it not only wastes my time but also affects my trust in your brand. I have frequently recommended Dilly and Carlo to others due to the quality of your products, but this situation has led to negative feedback from those I referred. As a long-standing customer who values your brand, I sincerely hope you can address this issue and improve the availability of your products. I look forward to your response and a resolution to this matter. CrewForShoots"

Dilly & Carlo,"Dress, Pants","Beautiful clothes but don't expect the staff to help you out. I'm always shopping in a rush therefore I ask the staff for help. One time I asked them if they have different colors in a pair of pants I loved and they said no. 2 mins later as I was walking and spotted what I was looking for! Same happened today, I asked one of the girls if they have anything similar to the dress I was holding and no. Unfortunately didn't have time to look around but I'm sure I would have found something if I had the time!"

Dilly & Carlo,Shirt,"This was my first visit and I'm quite impressed by the variety of clothing/household items and the quality of the products. I usually buy different brands of shirts, so it was surprising to see good shirts here. I bought a shirt that fit well, and felt good to wear (the material). I'd probably buy more later. They do have a good batik collection and some household items, which would be great for gifts too. They are moderately priced, not cheap (batiks), but I think they are relatively moderate. There's parking for a few cars too!"
