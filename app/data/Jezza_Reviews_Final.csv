Jezza,"Dress, Top","I had the pleasure of visiting Jezza Fashion's Dehiwala branch recently, and I am thoroughly impressed with both their service and the quality of their clothing. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly and felt welcomed. The store offers an extensive collection of both casual and formal dresses, each piece reflecting excellent craftsmanship and style. I want to highlight the exceptional service provided by Shaira, one of the staff members. Shaira's dedication to her job and her customers is truly commendable. She was incredibly attentive, helping me find exactly what I was looking for with her knowledgeable suggestions and keen eye for fashion. Her friendly and professional demeanor made my shopping experience not only efficient but also enjoyable. The attention to detail in their dress designs and the quality of the materials used is evident, making Jezza Fashion stand out from other retailers. Whether you're looking for something casual or a formal outfit for a special occasion, you can trust that you'll find something perfect here. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my experience at Jezza Fashion, Dehiwala. I highly recommend this store to anyone looking for top-notch service and high-quality fashion. Kudos to the team, and especially to Shaira, for making my visit exceptional. Shifara Samsudeen 1 review"

Jezza,Overall Dress,Ladies latest ready made dresses
Jezza,Pants,"Plenty of modest clothing for ladies. The quality isn‚Äôt that great, some materials get woolly/fluffy after a couple of wears and the sewing could definitely be better for the high prices they charge. They do exchange if you complain about the sewing defects or material issues after wearing which is only fair. Some items like pants are very overpriced. The staff is friendly and quite helpful, some can be quite pushy though. Yaz Deen"
Jezza,Overall Dress,They should add more designer clothes.
Jezza,Top,Favorite place. I use purchesing with available items. Anyway more designs need to be added. Some material Material quality should be improved. And need different pattern of tops. Consider the pricess. Above 3000 from single top is seems to be exaggerated amount. C.K. June
Jezza,Top,"As a Muslim girl, I'm an often buyer from Jezza since it fits all my needs. However, their cloth materials are terrible. I've told them this several times. The material is synthetic and it doesn't have a lining. You get boiled in Colombo when you wear it. Once you wash them, they shrink and lose color. Additionally, their fit on rooms at dehiwala out are terrible . So many times I have complained to fix some bright lights . Inside that fit on room lights where not bright enough and you can see shadows. I simply love the quality of the product what gflock produce. I do buy products from them, but most of the times I don‚Äôt like to wear tight out fit. But couple of outfits I have bought and wearing it for almost 10 years and still when I wear people ask me from where I bought it. Material quality is good and simply has the class. Jezza everytime after the purchase I have only regrets. If you can‚Äôt take our feedback and improve you must stop cheating people and their hard earn money. I think spending on good cloths is an investment we do for ourselves."
Jezza,Overall Dress,"Good collection of clothing, especially for ladies and kids ware. 1"

Jezza,Overall Dress,"Good place for women's clothing, parking is a challenge."
Jezza,Overall Dress,I've been in here three different times hoping something would catch my eye but I've never bought anything. Yes there is a large collection of good quality items but sadly I never found anything for me. Maybe there is a specific group of people who find it useful. The prices are so high that I really can't believe a simple viscose or whatever materials they have could amount to so much. I'm also curious why most of the dresses are a size 8 and below -_- The ones in larger sizes come in the most ugly designs. 1
Jezza,Overall Dress,trying out Jezza for the first time for this Eid and loved their collection. Never a ready made outfit person but just so satisfied shopping today for a wedding too. And thanks to Shaira for actually helping out a lot. She actually is a great staff. Maybe plus sizes and a couple of bigger sizes added to the size guide would be appropriate. Sajida Siham

Jezza,Overall Dress,"Cool collection, but the customer service is very poor in this branch. Staffs r not pleasant enough most of them r with an attitude face, they r like we r going there to shop for free. Other than that good collection. But please try to add some new designs, all the dress style look the same n typical always."
Jezza,Overall Dress,Though they have a nice collection the dress material is not so good. Once washed it shrinks and then it won‚Äôt fit. If you charge more for dresses please be kind to check the material before sewing.
