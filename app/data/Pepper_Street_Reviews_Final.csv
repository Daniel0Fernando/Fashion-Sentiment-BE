Pepper Street,"Caps, Hoodie","I recently purchased several clothing items from this shop and had a mixed experience. On the positive side, the hoodies and caps are quite good. They are comfortable, stylish, and seem to be made from better materials compared to other items. However, I found the overall quality of most other clothing items to be lacking. The materials are not up to standard and fade quickly after minimal use. Given the high prices, I expected much better durability and quality. Unfortunately, the price does not match the product quality for most items. While I can recommend the hoodies and caps, I would advise caution with other clothing items if you are seeking quality."

Pepper Street,"Shirt, T-Shirt","I went to the store today (16th) to return a T-shirt I bought on theth. The initial size I purchased was XL, but it ended up being too large, so I wanted to swap it for a smaller one. All the other items on the original receipt were fine, just the XL T-shirt was returned . Nonetheless, when I returned the T-shirt for an exchange, the customer service agent claimed that I had worn it and reattached the tags. He asserted that the threading on the label was unlike that on products sold in the store. Thus he believes I have taken the measure of reattaching the labels. I was astonished by his comments. Such inadequate customer service guarantees that this will be my final purchase from this store. Management must ensure that in the future, suitable training and guidance provided on the items sold, particularly regarding the materials used for attaching the tags to prevent this from happening againIan Stephen"

Definitely not recommending this shop to anyone.Nashath"
Pepper Street,Overall Dress,"Pepper St. Clothing at One Galle Face Mall offers a great selection of clothing for both ladies and gents. The in-store experience is excellent, with a supportive and understanding staff who make shopping enjoyable. Their collection is stylish, and the quality of the clothing is impressive. However, the online ordering process could use some improvement. There are occasional delays in order processing and responses, and it can be difficult to contact them via mobile at times. If they can enhance their online services, the experience would be perfect."

Pepper Street,T-Shirt,"I bought a polo shirt (t-shirt with a collar) from them. And I barely used it. It was among the highest priced polo shirts they have. When I ordered, it was the right size.

Pepper Street,Dress,"I am extremely disappointed with the online customer service. I had several questions about a product I was interested in purchasing, but getting a response was a nightmare. When I finally did receive a reply, it was generic and didn't address my specific concerns. The representatives seemed uninterested and unhelpful. This experience has made me reconsider shopping here again. A business that doesn't prioritize customer support is not one I can recommend. Games vid"

Pepper Street,T-Shirt,"I recently needed help from customer service because the t-shirt I bought was the wrong size. At first, it was hard to get in touch with the team on the phone, but once I did, the experience was great. The team was really nice and always kept me updated. I was impressed by how easy it was to return the t-shirt and get a new one with the coupon provided. My only tip is to maybe let people return or exchange items in the store too. Thanks for making sure I ended up with a t-shirt that fits. Your service is awesome!"
Pepper Street,Shorts,"Colors faded rapidly after the first wash, which was really disappointing."
Pepper Street,Cap,"if you are keen on quality local branded clothing, pepper street is one of the best options. You can find a unique variety of clothing items here. Talking about the pepper street the most attractive thing was the pepper smell inside the shop. That smell is a brilliant usage of marketing strategies. The wall paint also reminds me of the theme pepper."
Pepper Street,Pants,"I had a terrible experience with Pepper St. Usually, I wouldn't order clothes online. Instead, I used to go to their physical store and make purchases. On Thursday, I decided to visit their store after checking the opening time. Although they mentioned that they would open atAM, I went aroundPM. However, the store was closed beforePM. So I had to order their original collection via their website, and unfortunately, I received a pair of pants that were too big for me. When I tried to return the pants, I couldn't get through to their customer service. I had to use a friend's Instagram account to contact them since they weren't responding to my calls. I was informed that I couldn't exchange the pants in-store and had to go through their online process, which took several working days to complete. By the time I received my coupon for the exchange, the pants I wanted were already out of stock. I want to warn others not to waste their time and money on Pepper St. and to shop elsewhere for their favourite clothes."

Pepper Street,Cap,Do not order online. They are not sending what they promised! Bad choice for online shopping but good one for purchasing at the store! I ordered a black crewneck but they phoned and told black is not available. Then they told a green is available and i told yes for green but they have sent a different color! Not recommending!!! Chose visely....

Pepper Street,"Dress, Shirt","I recently visited the store and was disappointed with the service. I‚Äôve purchased many clothes from this store in the past because I really like their quality. However, during my recent visit, the cashier took a long time to process the bill for a one Tshirt, which I was okay with, but when I offered cash, she told me to bring change or pay by a card. But I left my card at home. This experience was upsetting; I expected better service, especially when it comes to something as basic as handling change. A polite apology or a better solution from the cashier would have made a big difference. and I hope the management addresses such issues to improve customer service.al waleedh"
Pepper Street,Shirt,I orderd a tshirtth of april. Today isrd of april. They are not even call me. Tracking number is also not showing.
Pepper Street,Overall Dress,Very good stuff and the prices are reasonable . Good collection .
Pepper Street,Joggers,The pockets are poorly designed and impractical for everyday use.
Pepper Street,Shirt,"I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received at your store today (24.12.24). I visited to exchange a shirt that was gifted to me. Although I didn‚Äôt have the bill (as it was a gift), the shirt still had its original tag intact. Unfortunately, your team informed me that they could not process the exchange without a receipt. While I understand the importance of store policies, I believe an exception could have been made given that the item was clearly unused and tagged. The rigid approach and lack of flexibility demonstrated by your staff felt unprofessional and did not align with the level of customer care I expected. As the only outlet in Sri Lanka, it‚Äôs crucial to prioritize building a positive reputation for customer service. A more accommodating and customer-focused approach would go a long way in creating a better shopping experience. I hope my feedback will be taken constructively to improve future interactions. Unfortunately, this experience has left me disappointed, and I would hesitate to recommend your store to others."
Pepper Street,Top,"Been purchasing from Pepper street from more than a year now and I‚Äôm glad to say that they haven‚Äôt disappointed me a bit. Use to purchase online from their website But once I started visiting their store at one galle face, it was whole new experience. I would definitely recommend you to visit their store cus it is really eye catching to see the wide variety of products and colours they got and most of all they have a damn friendly staff who assisted me with a smile on their face ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ÄùPleasant people‚Äù and I‚Äôm glad to say that they prioritise customer service on top of all. Highly recommended, do visit their store to get the same experience."
Pepper Street,Cap,I recently visited the Pepper St store at OGF and was met with rude staff from the moment I went in. The staff were unhelpful. When I asked something they were not smiling and gave rude replies and the cashier was impatient and careless. I won't be coming back.sameera chathuranga
Pepper Street,Joggers,"The joggers are versatile, pairing well with both sneakers and casual shoes."
Pepper Street,"Shirt, T-shirt","The customer service was very poor. I ordered a medium-sized T-shirt, but they sent a small one instead. Immediately upon receiving it, I called to report the issue. They initially instructed me to exchange it at their store in One Galle Face, but when I called to confirm, they told me to send a message on Instagram instead. They lack proper procedures to promptly assist customers. As of now, I haven't received any update from their side, and this situation is causing me trouble. If you're considering buying from them, please think twice because this issue could happen to you as well.nidhursha nidhu"
Pepper Street,Joggers,"They shrink noticeably after washing, which is very frustrating."
Pepper Street,Hoodie,"Great for layering on cooler days, it never feels too heavy."
Pepper Street,Joggers,They offer a flattering fit with just the right amount of stretch.
Pepper Street,Cap,"Nice clothes and accessories, however tourists need to be careful that the staff do not pocket the change themselves. Having to ask for my change soured the customer experience."
Pepper Street,T-shirt,I don't know what the hype is about. I bought a t shirt for my husband and he wore it only twice. Its color is faded and the t shirt is badly stretched out now. It wasn't a very reasonable price either. You'd honestly expect better quality for their price range.
