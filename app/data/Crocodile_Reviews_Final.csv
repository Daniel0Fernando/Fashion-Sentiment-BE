Crocodile,Flip Flops,Love the Flip Flops collection Udara Somachandra
Crocodile,"Shirt, T-Shirt","I recently visited your outlet and had a mixed experience that I'd like to share. On my first visit, I was assisted by an employee named Ridma. He was extremely helpful and ensured my shopping experience was smooth. I ended up purchasing three T-shirts, three casual trousers, one office trouser, and some casual wear. I was in a hurry that day, so I couldn't get the trousers adjusted for length. The next day, I returned to the store to get the measurements done but had forgotten my invoice. Since Ridma was busy with another customer, I approached another employee, a bald gentleman. Unfortunately, his response was very negative and dismissive, which left me feeling disappointed. Can't they even bring the bill? We have been told not to accept yours. I don't even know if the ones brought from other places will be manufactured under our labels. This cannot be named. Work has increased these days. It will take days to find that bill. Customer service plays such a big role in creating a lasting impression, and I don't think this individual demonstrated the skills or attitude required for the job. Thankfully, Ritma overheard the conversation and stepped in. He immediately recognized me from the previous day, tracked my invoice with just my mobile number, and resolved the issue efficiently. His professionalism and attentiveness were outstanding. I highly recommend providing the other employees with intensive customer service training, particularly on how to handle situations with a positive attitude and a smile. First impressions matter, and his approach left a negative impact. To Ridma, well done! You are an asset to the store, and I hope your dedication is recognized and rewarded. Thank you for making my experience memorable despite the initial challenges. Harsha Jayathilaka"
Crocodile,Shirt,Place is easy to find not hard. Just passed Mahanama college and it's there. Products are really good in quality. Wide variety of products are available and sizes are also available. But for the polos if you're hoping to buy light colours better to have them ordered online since most of the polos are out of stock. Same applies to the shirts as well. Better to call and confirm whether the product is available before visiting. The staff will assist you in finding different matches for your requirement. Anjalee Weerapperuma

Crocodile,"Shirt, T-Shirt","I had the pleasure of visiting the Crocodile Flagship Store in Colombo last Sunday, and I must say, it was an extraordinary shopping experience. My primary intention was to purchase some T-shirts, but I left with a newfound appreciation for the impeccable quality and craftsmanship this store offers. Upon entering, I was immediately struck by the elegant and tasteful layout of the store. The merchandise was neatly displayed, creating an inviting atmosphere that encouraged exploration. The store exuded a sense of luxury without being ostentatious, setting the stage for the premium products it housed. The selection of T-shirts was diverse, with a wide range of colors, styles, and sizes. Each piece was a testament to the brand's commitment to quality. The fabrics used were of the highest grade, ensuring comfort and durability. The attention to detail in stitching and finishing was evident, promising longevity even with frequent wear. It was clear that every garment had been meticulously crafted. One of the standout features of this establishment was its collection of wallets made from genuine crocodile leather. These wallets exuded opulence and sophistication, reflecting the brand's dedication to using only the finest materials. The craftsmanship was exceptional, evident in the precise stitching and impeccable finishing. Handling these wallets, one could feel the luxurious texture and appreciate the durability that comes with genuine crocodile leather. While the products at Crocodile Flagship Store may come with a premium price tag, the quality unquestionably justifies the investment. The durability and longevity of the items ensure they will remain in one's wardrobe for years to come, making them a true value for money. The staff at the store were attentive and knowledgeable, providing helpful suggestions and ensuring a seamless shopping experience. They were able to answer all my queries about the products and provided valuable insights about the brand's ethos and commitment to quality. In conclusion, my visit to Crocodile Flagship Store in Colombo was nothing short of exceptional. The highest quality products, particularly the T-shirts and wallets, combined with the store's elegant ambiance and knowledgeable staff, made for a shopping experience that was truly one of a kind. If you're seeking premium, enduring pieces for your wardrobe, this store should be at the top of your list. It's safe to say that Crocodile Flagship Store has set a new standard for luxury shopping in Colombo. Shameez"
Crocodile,Flip Flops,"I ordered a pair of flip flops maroon colour through the website. By mentioning the size as but they have sent me the pair of flip flop from the size and it's too small for me. I ordered it because at the website it was mentioning that the size was availabe and also in the receipt it's clearly mentioned that I have ordered the size . These people are just cheating the customers if they doesn't have the size they should have update the website or else just inform me that they doesn't have it In stock so that I can go with another option, before sending my order through the courier and also it took days to receive my package. Here after it's much better to think twice before ordering something from the crocodile flagship store. Kaveesha Bandara Kaveesha Bandara Kaveesha Bandara Milan Tharaka Siyambalapitiya"

I'm not sure about the reason, but it would be better if she were a bit more polite. Despite that, it's still the best place to visit for Crocodile fans. Rasika Gunathunga"

Crocodile,"Dress, Shirt, T-Shirt","I recently visited your store and had an unfortunate experience with a shop assistant. I noticed a stain on one of the T-shirts available for purchase and politely inquired about it. Instead of addressing my concern professionally, the assistant suggested that I clean the stain with toothpaste. When I expressed that paying full price for a stained item didn’t feel like value for money, the response was dismissive and unhelpful. I believe customer-facing staff should be trained to handle such situations with empathy and professionalism. It’s essential for a brand like Crocodile to ensure customers feel respected and valued during their shopping experience. I hope this feedback helps improve service standards, and I’d be happy to discuss this further if needed. Naveen Karunarathne"

Crocodile,"Dress, Shoes",Egostic store manager and staff. Went there to utilize some gift vouchers and as soon as they saw that they started ignoring me and I was wearing flip-flops. They then served a gentleman came after me (well dressed) and let me hang in the counter for nearly minutes. Both of them serving him while make me wait. I asked for pair of shoes and they told me they don't have any stock and what displayed only can be purchased while I'm not sure if it is completely true. Basically they stereotype people comes there by their look. Not a single smile or casual talk. Just rude talks and glares. Utterly disappointed and disgusting. Sakuni Jayabahu review

Crocodile,"Shirt, T-Shirt","I had the pleasure of visiting the Crocodile Flagship Store in Colombo last Sunday, and I must say, it was an extraordinary shopping experience. My primary intention was to purchase some T-shirts, but I left with a newfound appreciation for the impeccable quality and craftsmanship this store offers. Upon entering, I was immediately struck by the elegant and tasteful layout of the store. The merchandise was neatly displayed, creating an inviting atmosphere that encouraged exploration. The store exuded a sense of luxury without being ostentatious, setting the stage for the premium products it housed. The selection of T-shirts was diverse, with a wide range of colors, styles, and sizes. Each piece was a testament to the brand's commitment to quality. The fabrics used were of the highest grade, ensuring comfort and durability. The attention to detail in stitching and finishing was evident, promising longevity even with frequent wear. It was clear that every garment had been meticulously crafted. One of the standout features of this establishment was its collection of wallets made from genuine crocodile leather. These wallets exuded opulence and sophistication, reflecting the brand's dedication to using only the finest materials. The craftsmanship was exceptional, evident in the precise stitching and impeccable finishing. Handling these wallets, one could feel the luxurious texture and appreciate the durability that comes with genuine crocodile leather. While the products at Crocodile Flagship Store may come with a premium price tag, the quality unquestionably justifies the investment. The durability and longevity of the items ensure they will remain in one's wardrobe for years to come, making them a true value for money. The staff at the store were attentive and knowledgeable, providing helpful suggestions and ensuring a seamless shopping experience. They were able to answer all my queries about the products and provided valuable insights about the brand's ethos and commitment to quality. In conclusion, my visit to Crocodile Flagship Store in Colombo was nothing short of exceptional. The highest quality products, particularly the T-shirts and wallets, combined with the store's elegant ambiance and knowledgeable staff, made for a shopping experience that was truly one of a kind. If you're seeking premium, enduring pieces for your wardrobe, this store should be at the top of your list. It's safe to say that Crocodile Flagship Store has set a new standard for luxury shopping in Colombo. Shameez"
Crocodile,Flip Flops,"I ordered a pair of flip flops maroon colour through the website. By mentioning the size as but they have sent me the pair of flip flop from the size and it's too small for me. I ordered it because at the website it was mentioning that the size was availabe and also in the receipt it's clearly mentioned that I have ordered the size . These people are just cheating the customers if they doesn't have the size they should have update the website or else just inform me that they doesn't have it In stock so that I can go with another option, before sending my order through the courier and also it took days to receive my package. Here after it's much better to think twice before ordering something from the crocodile flagship store. Kaveesha Bandara Kaveesha Bandara Kaveesha Bandara Milan Tharaka Siyambalapitiya"

However, the issue I encountered was with the lady working there. She wasn't very supportive and seemed to look at customers with annoyance. I'm not sure about the reason, but it would be better if she were a bit more polite. Despite that, it's still the best place to visit for Crocodile fans. Rasika Gunathunga"

Crocodile,"Dress, Shirt, T-Shirt","I recently visited your store and had an unfortunate experience with a shop assistant. I noticed a stain on one of the T-shirts available for purchase and politely inquired about it. Instead of addressing my concern professionally, the assistant suggested that I clean the stain with toothpaste. When I expressed that paying full price for a stained item didn’t feel like value for money, the response was dismissive and unhelpful. I believe customer-facing staff should be trained to handle such situations with empathy and professionalism. It’s essential for a brand like Crocodile to ensure customers feel respected and valued during their shopping experience. I hope this feedback helps improve service standards, and I’d be happy to discuss this further if needed. Naveen Karunarathne"
