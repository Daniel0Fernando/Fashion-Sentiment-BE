Kelly Felder,Denim,I bought two denims from this shop. I don't recommend this for denims. They are very expensive and not worth it at all. Very poor quality. I couldn't wear them at least 5 months.

Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"I experienced bad service fromKellyfelder . I placed an order for a dress on April 9th and was assured it would be delivered on or before April 11th. However, as of April 14th, the dress has not been dispatched from their warehouse. After inquiring, they informed me that they do not have the dress in stock. This has been the worst service I have ever encountered"
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,If you're looking for both quality and style this is a place you must check out. Don't forget to check their SALE dates too.. just to dig out good pieces for a cheaper price
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"!st time i went, options were really good.. clothes were very stylish. prices were also normal... on my second visit (16/01/2024) clothes were limited especially mens but ok"
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"Got a lot of really nice clothes (only women's wear) with the modern look and feel. Color variety is pretty low though, also clothes variety range is pretty limited with most clothes looking the same, very minor changes between them. There staff is very helpful. Nice shopping environment. Overall the sheer quality and brand name attracts a lot of customers. There are also a lot of a discounts and stock clearance sales carried out here, allowing more worth for less money. Menuka Gunawardana"

Kelly Felder,Shirt,"The staff here are so amazing.. I love the amount of training and how customer centric the staff at Kelly Felder are, I was here on the 24th, I was really tired after a day of Christmas shopping and when I went to Kelly Felder, I went to exchange some clothes I had bought online, the staff were really so polite and friendly, as someone who regularly shops online since covid, the whole experience of in-shop shopping is harder for me, being in a time cinch also, I asked a guy, can you show me this shirt, and showed it to him from the Kelly Felder website on my phone, the guy not only showed me where it was kept in the store but also asked me what my size was and he found it for me.. Being used to the atrocious uptight ego centric behavior of Gflock staff, I was so pleasantly taken aback, and the cashier (I wish I remember his name) he was super busy, but he noted that I looked tired and he asked me why, he was so friendly and chatted to me while he was ringing up my bill, with a smile, even though he was so busy, he had a smile and some very inspiring words for me, thank you Kelly Felder, your staff are a gem to you, I will consider shopping at Kelly Felder over GFlock because of the amazing staff they have employed.. Gflock staff suck BTW!"
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"Good quality clothing with a lot of designs to suite ladies' desire. Prices are high, but ultimately they are designer clothing. So no complaints. Atmosphere is suited for shopping. Friendly staff. Praneedi Perera"
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,No accessibility options. They have a medium staircase to enter and a huuuge staircase inside to go to the first floor. I’m currently very pregnant and not supposed to climb stairs. Asked the staff if they have a lift and they simply said no. Weren’t even friendly enough to offer to bring down styles of dresses I’d like to see. Hence rating poorly for poor customer service. Graycieon Perera
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"We are patronizing this place from a long time, and A place for ladies. Prices are also comparatively reasonable. Staff here is very friendly and they will help you by every means. There are two stories for ladies. This place is very famous and popular among the young office crowd. You can choose office to party wear from their wide range of collection. sahan karunarathne"

Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,They consistently design beautiful and elegant dresses. I have yet to find another fashion store in Colombo with as much quality and class as Kelly Felder. And they have new collections every week. Love their music playlist too :D I highly recommend them!!
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,Nice atmosphere and good staff. Only downside was there wasn't any sizes available on many of the clothing. Also went to buy some menswear from redvers buller and there was not much choice. But on facebook they had a great collection. Hope they will restock soon as wanted to buy few more items but they didn't have the correct sizes and availability.
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"Good collection of women's clothes, and quite an affordable price (average range between 1500 and 3500 Rs). Sizes are in UK, US, EUR and AUS. Also the staffmembers don't follow you, so you can leisurely get a look at the clothes. Just one floor though, there is room for a bit of expansion. Recommended for qualitative clothes at a reasonable price. Sandunika Diyamini"

Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"I've visited Kelly Felder several times before. Nothing was wrong until I decided to exchange a dress I bought few days back. The bill said exchange is ""possible"" and there were no exclusive items mentioned. But the staff refused to exchange saying that the dress I bought is not an exchangeable item.

Kelly Felder,Shirt,"The staff here are so amazing.. I love the amount of training and how customer centric the staff at Kelly Felder are, I was here on the 24th, I was really tired after a day of Christmas shopping and when I went to Kelly Felder, I went to exchange some clothes I had bought online, the staff were really so polite and friendly, as someone who regularly shops online since covid, the whole experience of in-shop shopping is harder for me, being in a time cinch also, I asked a guy, can you show me this shirt, and showed it to him from the Kelly Felder website on my phone, the guy not only showed me where it was kept in the store but also asked me what my size was and he found it for me.. Being used to the atrocious uptight ego centric behavior of Gflock staff, I was so pleasantly taken aback, and the cashier (I wish I remember his name) he was super busy, but he noted that I looked tired and he asked me why, he was so friendly and chatted to me while he was ringing up my bill, with a smile, even though he was so busy, he had a smile and some very inspiring words for me, thank you Kelly Felder, your staff are a gem to you, I will consider shopping at Kelly Felder over GFlock because of the amazing staff they have employed.. Gflock staff suck BTW!"
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"Good quality clothing with a lot of designs to suite ladies' desire. Prices are high, but ultimately they are designer clothing. So no complaints. Atmosphere is suited for shopping. Friendly staff. Praneedi Perera"
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,No accessibility options. They have a medium staircase to enter and a huuuge staircase inside to go to the first floor. I’m currently very pregnant and not supposed to climb stairs. Asked the staff if they have a lift and they simply said no. Weren’t even friendly enough to offer to bring down styles of dresses I’d like to see. Hence rating poorly for poor customer service. Graycieon Perera
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"We are patronizing this place from a long time, and A place for ladies. Prices are also comparatively reasonable.

Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,Nice atmosphere and good staff. Only downside was there wasn't any sizes available on many of the clothing. Also went to buy some menswear from redvers buller and there was not much choice. But on facebook they had a great collection. Hope they will restock soon as wanted to buy few more items but they didn't have the correct sizes and availability.
Kelly Felder,Overall Dress,"Good collection of women's clothes, and quite an affordable price (average range between 1500 and 3500 Rs). Sizes are in UK, US, EUR and AUS. Also the staffmembers don't follow you, so you can leisurely get a look at the clothes. Just one floor though, there is room for a bit of expansion. Recommended for qualitative clothes at a reasonable price. Sandunika Diyamini"
